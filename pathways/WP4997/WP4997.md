description: The association between blood type and disease has been studied since
  the beginning of the 20th Century (Anstee 2010, Ewald & Sumner 2016). Landsteiner's
  discovery of blood groups in 1900 was based on agglutination patterns of red blood
  cells when blood types from different donors were mixed (Landsteiner 1931, Owen
  2000, Tan & Graham 2013). His work is the basis of routine compatibility testing
  and transfusion practices today. The immune system of patients receiving blood transfusions
  will attack any donor red blood cells that contain antigens that differ from their
  self-antigens. Therefore, matching blood types is essential for safe blood transfusions.
  Landsteiner's classification of the ABO blood groups confirmed that  antigens were
  inherited characteristics. In the 1940s, it was established that the specificity
  of blood group antigens was determined by their unique oligosaccharide structures.
  Since then, exponential advances in technology have resulted in the identification
  of over 300 blood group antigens, classified into more than 35 blood group systems
  by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) (Storry et al. 2016).<br><br>Blood
  group antigens comprise either a protein portion or oligosaccharide sequence attached
  on a glycolipid or glycoprotein. The addition of one or more specific sugar molecules
  to this oligosaccharide sequence at specific positions by a variety of glycosyltransferases
  results in the formation of mature blood group antigens. The genes that code for
  glycosytransferases can contain genetic changes that produce antigenic differences,
  resulting in new antigens or loss of expression. Blood group antigens are found
  on red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, leukocytes, and plasma proteins and also exist
  in soluble form in bodily secretions such as breast milk, seminal fluid, saliva,
  sweat, gastric secretions and urine. Blood groups are implicated in many diseases
  such as those related to malignancy (Rummel & Ellsworth 2016), the cardiovascular
  system (Liumbruno & Franchini 2013), metabolism (Meo et al. 2016, Ewald & Sumner
  2016) and infection (Rios & Bianco 2000, McCullough 2014). The most important and
  best-studied blood groups are the ABO, Lewis and Rhesus systems. The biosynthesis
  of the antigens in these systems is described in this section.  View original pathway
