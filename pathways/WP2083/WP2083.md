description: '  Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance
  that acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for
  tobacco dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through
  the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous
  system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the
  ganglion type and the CNS type.  In dopaminergic neurons in the CNS, nicotine binds
  to the CNS-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The main type of CNS receptor
  is composed of alpha 4 beta 2 (CHRNA4, CHRNB2) subunits. It has been shown that
  alpha 6, alpha 5, and beta 3 can also be in the receptor complex to modulate binding
  sensitivity. By binding to the receptor, nicotine causes cell depolarization and
  release of dopamine from the cell through the SNARE complex. Dopamine then binds
  to dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) on dopaminergic terminals and activates
  Gi alpha (GNAI1), initiating a feedback loop to inhibit dopamine release. One of
  the key players mediating dopamine signaling is PPP1R1B (also called DARPP-32, dopamine
  and cyclic AMP-regulated phospho-protein). PPP1R1B is a bifunctional signal transduction
  molecule which, by distinct mechanisms, inhibits either a serine/threonine kinase
  (PPKACA or PKA) or a serine/threonine phosphatase (PPP1CA or protein phosphatase
  1). When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by PPKACA at threonine 34, it is an inhibitor
  of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), which inhibits dopamine secretion through the
  SNARE complex. When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by CDK5 at threonine 75, it is converted
  to an inhibitor of PPKACA. Binding of dopamine to D2-like dopamine receptors leads
  to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (ADCY2) via G-protein GNAI1, and decreases PKA-stimulated
  phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34. This, in turn, relieves the inhibition of
  protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), and inhibits further dopamine release.  Sources:
