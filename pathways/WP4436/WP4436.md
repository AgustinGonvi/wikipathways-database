description: NTRK2 (TRKB) belongs to the family of neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptors,
  also known as NTRKs or TRKs. Besides NTRK2, the family includes NTRK1 (TRKA) and
  NTRK3 (TRKC). Similar to other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), NTRK2 is activated
  by ligand binding to its extracellular domain. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization,
  followed by trans-autophosphorylation of dimerized receptors on conserved tyrosine
  residues in the cytoplasmic region. Phosphorylated tyrosines in the intracellular
  domain of the receptor serve as docking sites for adapter proteins, triggering downstream
  signaling cascaded. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4
  (NTF4, also known as NT-4) are two high affinity ligands for NTRK2. Neurotrophin-3
  (NTF3, also known as NT-3), a high affinity ligand for NTRK3, binds to NTRK2 with
  low affinity and it is not clear if it the low level of activation of NTRK2 by NTF3
  plays a physiologically relevant role. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a high affinity
  ligand for NTRK1, does not interact with NTRK2. NTRK2 activation triggers downstream
  RAS, PI3K, and PLCgamma signaling cascades, thought to be involved in neuronal development
  in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). In addition, NTRK2
  plays an important, but poorly elucidated, role in long-term potentiation (LTP)
  and learning (reviewed by Minichiello 2009). NTRK2 may modify neuronal excitability
  and synaptic transmission by directly phosphorylating voltage gated channels (Rogalski
  et al. 2000).<p><p>It was recently demonstrated that the protein tyrosine phosphatase
  PTPN12 negatively regulates NTRK2 signaling and neurite outgrowth. In the presence
  of PTPN12, NTRK2 phosphorylation at tyrosine Y816 decreases. It has not yet been
  demonstrated that PTPN12 acts directly to dephosphorylate Y816 (and possibly other
  phosphotyrosines) of NTRK2 (Ambjorn et al. 2013).<p><p>Binding of SH2D1A (SAP) to

  (Pandya et al. 2014). NTRK2 undergoes ubiquitination by the TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complex. While ubiquitination by the TRAF6 complex negatively regulates NTRK2 induced

  by NTF4 may protect NTRK2 from the lysosome degradation route (Proenca et al. 2016).  View
