description: This pathway is based on figure 1 of "Alteration of Notch signaling in
  skeletal development and disease" (see bibliography). In the NOTCH signaling pathway,
  mammals have 11 ligands (JAG, DLL, DLK, etc.) and 4 NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1,2,3,4).
  The pathway is activated by the interaction between a ligand in a ligand expressing
  cell and a NOTCH receptor in an adjacent, receptor expressing cell.  At this point,
  proteases (ADAM10 and PSEN1/2) cleave the intracellular domain (NICD) of the NOTCH
  protein from the extracellular domain (NECD). In the canonical pathway, NICD travels
  into the nucleus where it forms a transcription complex with other proteins (RBPJ
  and MAML1,2,3). This transcriptional complex regulates the transcription of downstream
  canonical target genes, such as HES1 and HEY1. In the non-canonical pathway, otherwise
  known as RBPJ-independent NOTCH signaling, NOTCH can activate through R-Ras to promote
  cell adhesion. Alternatively, NOTCH may interact with IKKa in the NF-kB pathway,
  or LEF1 in the Wnt pathway.While the role that the canonical NOTCH pathway plays
  in skeletal biology is well understood, our understanding of the role of the non-canonical
  pathway remains primitive.
