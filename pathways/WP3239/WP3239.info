Description: P53 is not a lonely genome guardian, it operates with the assistance of p73 and p63 within a complex network including distinct but complementary pathways. This protein family presents a      high level of sequence homology in its DNA binding domain. The complexity of the family has been enriched by the alternatively spliced forms of the genes. At present pathway, the alternatively spliced forms of p63 and p73 and how they interact with p53 are shown . However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of p53 family members. Further studies will tell us whether the three genes of the family also share others regulatory activities.
