description: 'Cholesterol is a waxy steroid metabolite found in the cell membranes
  and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. It is an essential structural
  component of mammalian cell membranes, where it is required to establish proper
  membrane permeability and fluidity. In addition, cholesterol is an important component
  for the manufacture of bile acids, steroid hormones, and several fat-soluble vitamins.
  Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by animals, but small quantities
  are synthesized in other eukaryotes, such as plants and fungi. It is almost completely
  absent among prokaryotes, which include bacteria.  Source: [[wikipedia:Cholesterol|Wikipedia]]'
