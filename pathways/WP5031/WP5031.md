description: An important cofactor for carboxylation reaction is the vitamin Biotin.
  Four carboxylase groups (ACC, MCC, PCC and PC) are activated by binding to biotin
  and forming holocarboxylases, which in turn are responsible for several metabolic
  conversion in the Fatty Acid Synthesis, Leucine catabolism, propanoate metabolism
  and gluconeogenesis. Except for the ACC conversion from acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA
  starting the fatty acid synthesis, all other three interactions are connected to
  disorders. Furthermore, one can distinguish two "multiple carboxylase defects" (MCDs),
  which are connected to the conversion of biocytin into biotin (BTD), or unbound
  biotin to one of the apocarboxylases (HCSD).   This pathway was inspired by Chapter
  14 (edition 4) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
