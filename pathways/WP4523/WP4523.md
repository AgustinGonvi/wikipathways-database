description: The biosynthesis of steroid hormones is a difficult process in which
  Cholesterol is transformed into mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and sex hormones
  via a series of hydroxylation, oxidation and reduction steps. To better understand
  the molecular level of sexual organ maturation in humans, the classical pathway
  and the alternative pathway of this process are produced. The pathways produce the
  main steroid hormones in humans, namely Progestogen, Corticosteroids, Androgens
  and Estrogens.  The classical pathway is meant to produce an important steroid called
  Androgen, which is a synthetic steroid hormone that regulates sexual development
  and the maintenance of the male sex organs via binding to androgen receptors. Next
  to the classical pathway of androgen synthesis, alternative pathways are known,
  such as [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4524].  For more information
  and details about Androgens and the diseases linked with this molecular pathway,
  please visit Chapter 37 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)) .  We
  have recently expanded this pathway with information from the Glucocorticoid and
  Mineralocorticoid Metabolism (previously captured in WP273; overlapping content
  is indicated with double borders for individual datanodes; information previously
  missing is added with dashed borders).  Mineralocorticoid (M) and glucocorticoid
  (G) receptors regulate transcription; either through 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  influencing aldosterone specificity on epithelial M-receptors or by modulcation
  of AP-1- and NF-kappa-B-induced transcription through G-receptors. Specifically
  for the first case, aldosterone resistance in an autosomal form (aka pseudohypoaldosteronism)
  is linked to loss-of-function in epithelical Na-channel subunits [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.48.1.231].
