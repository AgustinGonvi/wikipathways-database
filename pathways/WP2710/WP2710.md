description: The Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway activates the destruction of
  mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) (reviewed in Isken and Maquat
  2007, Chang et al. 2007, Behm-Ansmant et al. 2007, Neu-Yilik and Kulozik 2008, Rebbapragada
  and Lykke-Andersen 2009, Bhuvanagiri et al. 2010, Nicholson et al. 2010, Durand
  and Lykke-Andersen 2011). In mammalian cells a termination codon can be recognized
  as premature if it precedes an exon-exon junction by at least 50-55 nucleotides
  or if it is followed by an abnormal 3' untranslated region (UTR). While length of
  the UTR may play a part, the qualifications for being "abnormal" have not been fully
  elucidated. Also, some termination codons preceding exon junctions are not degraded
  by NMD so the criteria for triggering NMD are not yet fully known (reviewed in Rebbapragada
  and Lykke-Andersen 2009). While about 30% of disease-associated mutations in humans
  activate NMD, about 10% of normal human transcripts are also degraded by NMD (reviewed
  in Stalder and Muhlemann 2008, Neu-Yilik and Kulozik 2008, Bhuvanagiri et al. 2010,  Nicholson
  et al. 2010). Thus NMD is a normal physiological process controlling mRNA stability
  in unmutated cells.<br>Exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited on an mRNA during
  splicing in the nucleus and are displaced by ribosomes during the first round of
  translation. When a ribosome terminates translation the A site encounters the termination
  codon and the eRF1 factor enters the empty A site and recruits eRF3. Normally, eRF1
  cleaves the translated polypeptide from the tRNA in the P site and eRF3 interacts
  with Polyadenylate-binding protein (PABP) bound to the polyadenylated tail of the
  mRNA.<br>During activation of NMD eRF3 interacts with UPF1 which is contained in
  a complex with SMG1, SMG8, and SMG9. NMD can arbitrarily be divided into EJC-enhanced
  and EJC-independent pathways. In EJC-enhanced NMD, an exon junction is located downstream
  of the PTC and the EJC remains on the mRNA after termination of the pioneer round
  of translation. The core EJC is associated with UPF2 and UPF3, which interact with
  UPF1 and stimulate NMD. Once bound near the PTC, UPF1 is phosphorylated by SMG1.
  The phosphorylation is the rate-limiting step in NMD and causes UPF1 to recruit
  either SMG6, which is an endoribonuclease, or SMG5 and SMG7, which recruit ribonucleases.
  SMG6 and SMG5:SMG7 recruit phosphatase PP2A to dephosphorylate UPF1 and allow further
  rounds of degradation. How EJC-independent NMD is activated remains enigmatic but
  may involve competition between PABP and UPF1 for eRF3.  View original pathway at
