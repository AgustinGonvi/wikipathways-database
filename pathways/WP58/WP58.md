description: 'G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are also known as seven-(pass)-transmembrane
  domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor, and
  G protein–linked receptors (GPLR), constitute a large protein family of receptors
  that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal signal transduction
  pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. Coupling with G proteins, they are
  called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane
  seven times. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein–coupled_receptor Wikipedia]   Monoamine
  GPCRs are Rhodopsin-like GPCRs that bind to monoamine neurotransmitters. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_neurotransmitter
