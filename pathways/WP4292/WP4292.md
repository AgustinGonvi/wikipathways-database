description: This pathway visualises the conversion of methionine to inorganic sulphates
  (involving the formation of homocysteine, a  toxic intermediate also related to
  MTHFR deficiency [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4288]). Methionine,
  an essential amino acid, is taken in from diet and can be created from breaking
  down proteins.  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 3 of the book of Blau (ISBN
  3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
