description: 'Simplified PDGFR-beta pathway, based on figure 7B from Zhang et al:
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27372738  Platelet-derived growth factor receptors
  (PDGFR) are cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors for members of the platelet-derived
  growth factor (PDGF) family. PDGF subunits -A and -B are important factors regulating
  cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, cell growth, development and many
  diseases including cancer. There are two forms of the PDGFR, alpha and beta each
  encoded by a different gene. Depending on which growth factor is bound, PDGFR homo-
  or heterodimerizes.  Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-derived_growth_factor_receptor
