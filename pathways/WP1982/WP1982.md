description: 'Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are membrane-bound
  proteins that act as transcription factors. They regulate lipid, especially cholesterol,
  biosynthesis and uptake at a transcriptional level to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis.
  In addition, SREBP appears to be involved in a variety of other cellular processes.
  This pathway of SREBP focusses on the regulation of lipid metabolism by SREBP. The
  data on which this pathway is based, is derived from a variety of in vitro and in
  vivo studies using different species, including mouse, rat, hamster and human.  This
  pathway served as the basis for a review about SREBP that was published in Genes
  and Nutrition: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23516131 PubMed].  Proteins on
  this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1982
  CPTAC Assay Portal].'
