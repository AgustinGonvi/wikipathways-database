description: These reactions mediate the synthesis of glutamate and glutamine from
  ammonia and TCA cycle intermediates and allow the utilization of the carbon atoms
  from these amino acids for glucose synthesis under fasting conditions. These reactions
  also provide a means to collect nitrogen, both as ammonia and as amino groups, and
  direct it towards urea synthesis. Transamination, the conversion of an amino acid
  to the corresponding alpha-keto acid coupled to the conversion of a molecule of
  2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) to glutamate, is the first step in the catabolism
  of most amino acids. Transamination reactions are freely reversible so they also
  provide a means to balance concentrations of various amino acids and 2-oxo (alpha-keto)
  acids in the cell (Felig 1975; HÃ¤ussinger 1990; Owen et al. 1979).  View original
