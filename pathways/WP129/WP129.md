description: 'Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases;
  other family members are adamalysins, serralysins, and astacins. The MMPs belong
  to a larger family of proteases known as the metzincin superfamily. Collectively
  they are capable of degrading all kinds of extracellular matrix proteins, but also
  can process a number of bioactive molecules. They are known to be involved in the
  cleavage of cell surface receptors, the release of apoptotic ligands (such as the
  FAS ligand), and chemokine/cytokine in/activation. MMPs are also thought to play
  a major role on cell behaviors such as cell proliferation, migration (adhesion/dispersion),
  differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and host defense.  Source: [[wikipedia:Matrix_metalloproteinase|Wikipedia]]  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP129
