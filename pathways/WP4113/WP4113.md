description: Acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone collectively are called
  ketone bodies. The first two are synthesized from acetyl-CoA, in the mitochondria
  of liver cells; acetone is formed by spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate.
  Ketone body synthesis in liver is effectively irreversible because the enzyme that
  catalyzes the conversion of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA is not present in liver
  cells.<P>Ketone bodies, unlike fatty acids and triglycerides, are water-soluble.
  They are exported from the liver, and are taken up by other tissues, notably brain
  and skeletal and cardiac muscle. There, they are broken down to acetyl-CoA which
  is oxidized via the TCA cycle to yield energy. In a normal person, this pathway
  of ketone body synthesis and utilization is most active during extended periods
  of fasting. Under these conditions, mobilization and breakdown of stored fatty acids
  generates abundant acetyl-CoA acetyl-CoA in liver cells for synthesis of ketone
  bodies, and their utilization in other tissues minimizes the demand of these tissues
  for glucose (Sass 2011).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=74182
