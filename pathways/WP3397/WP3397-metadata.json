  "description": "PKN1, activated by phosphorylation at threonine T774, binds activated AR (androgen receptor) and promotes transcription from AR-regulated promoters. On one hand, phosphorylated PKN1 promotes the formation of a functional complex of AR with the transcriptional coactivator NCOA2 (TIF2) (Metzger et al. 2003). On the other hand, binding of phosphorylated PKN1, in complex with the activated AR, to androgen-reponsive promoters of KLK2 and KLK3 (PSA) genes, leads to PKN1-mediated histone phosphorylation. PKN1-phosphorylated histones recruit histone demethylases KDM4C (JMJD2C) and KDM1A (LSD1), and the ensuing demethylation of histones associated with the promoter regions of KLK2 and KLK3 genes increases their transcription (Metzger et al. 2005, Metzger et al. 2008).
