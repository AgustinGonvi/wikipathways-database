description: 'Fatty acid synthesis is the creation of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA
  and NADPH through the action of enzymes called fatty acid synthases. This process
  takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. Most of the acetyl-CoA which is converted
  into fatty acids is derived from carbohydrates via the glycolytic pathway. Source:
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_synthesis Wikipedia]  Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP357
