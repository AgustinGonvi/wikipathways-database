description: Rhotekin (RTKN) is a protein with an N-terminally located RHO GTPase
  binding domain, that shares a limited sequence homology with PKNs and rhophilins.
  RTKN binds to GTP-bound RHOA, RHOB and RHOC and can inhibit their GTPase activity
  (Reid et al. 1996, Fu et al. 2000), which can be corroborated by protein kinase
  D-mediated phosphorylation of RTKN (Pusapati et al. 2012). RTKN is implicated in
  the establishment of cell polarity (Sudo et al. 2006), septin organization (Ito
  et al. 2005, Sudo et al. 2007) and stimulation of SRF-mediated transcription (Reynaud
  et al. 2000). RTKN can have an anti-apoptotic effect that depends on the activation
  of NFKB (NF-kappaB) (Liu et al. 2004). RTKN2 (rhotekin-2) is another rhotekin exclusively
  expressed in lymphocytes (Collier et al. 2004). The function and the mechanism of
  action of RTKN2 are unknown.<p>Rhophillins include two family members - rhophilin-1
  (RHNP1) and rhophilin-2 (RHPN2) with ~75% sequence identity. A RHO GTPase binding
  domain is located at the N-terminus of rhophilins, followed by a BRO1 domain (characteristic
  of proteins involved in protein kinase C signaling) and a C-terminal PDZ domain.
  RHOA:GTP binds both RHPN1 and RHPN2 and these interactions may be involved in organization
  of the actin cytoskeleton and/or cell motility (Watanabe et al. 1996, Fujita et
  al. 2000, Peck et al. 2002). RHOB:GTP recruits RHPN2 to endosomes which may be involved
  in the function of thyroid cells (Mircescu et al. 2002).  View original pathway
