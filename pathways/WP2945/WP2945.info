Description: The plant growth hormones auxin and cytokinin along with strigolactones play an active role in plant development. The pathway diagram shows interaction of growth hormone mediated regulation of gene activities and role in various plant part development.   In the root apical meristem development section the paralogs of A. thaliana AHKs and AHPs were listed as family group members and not as members of the complex.
