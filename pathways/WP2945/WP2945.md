description: The plant growth hormones auxin and cytokinin along with strigolactones
  play an active role in plant development. The pathway diagram shows interaction
  of growth hormone mediated regulation of gene activities and role in various plant
  part development.   In the root apical meristem development section the paralogs
  of A. thaliana AHKs and AHPs were listed as family group members and not as members
  of the complex.
