Description: Insulin signaling influences energy metabolism as well as growth.

Other branches of the signal cascade lead to cell growth and differentiation.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP481 CPTAC Assay Portal]
