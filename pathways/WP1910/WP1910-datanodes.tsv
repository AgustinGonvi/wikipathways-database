EGFR L861Q 	Protein	P00533	Uniprot-TrEMBL	L861Q, a substitution of leucine 861 with glutamine, is a documented EGFR mutation in the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Leu861, encoded by exon 21, localizes to the N-terminal portion of the activation loop (A loop) of the kinase domain of EGFR and together with Leu858 participates in hydrophobic interactions that keep the kinase in the inactive conformation (Zhang et al. 2006). Replacement of Leu861 with glutamine is expected to destabilize the inactive conformation of EGFR and result in constitutive catalytic activity (Zhang et al. 2006). NSCLCs harboring L861Q mutation in EGFR are responsive to small EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors from the 4-anilinoquinazoline group gefitinib (Lynch et al. 2004) and are expected to be responsive to the related drug, erlotinib.

EGFR L858R 	Protein	P00533	Uniprot-TrEMBL	L858R, a substitution of leucine 858 with arginine, accounts for ~40% of EGFR mutations in the non-small-cell lung cancer. L858R, encoded by exon 21, localizes to the N-terminal portion of the activation loop (A loop) of the kinase domain of EGFR. By locking the EGFR in its active conformation, L858R mutation results in constitutive catalytic activity of EGFR which is ~50-fold higher than the activity of the wild-type enzyme (Yun et al. 2007). The L858R EGFR mutant is inhibited by binding of small EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors from the 4-anilinoquinazoline group, erlotinib and gefitinib, as well as the pyrrolopyrimidine compound AEE788. Gefitinib is ~100-fold more potent against the L858R mutant than against the wild-type EGFR kinase (Yun et al. 2007). Erlotinib (Pao et al. 2004) and AEE788 (Yun et al. 2007) are also more efficient in inhibiting the L858R mutant than the wild-type EGFR.

PIP3 activates AKT
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-1257604	Reactome	Signaling by AKT is one of the key outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. AKT is activated by the cellular second messenger PIP3, a phospholipid that is generated by PI3K. In ustimulated cells, PI3K class IA enzymes reside in the cytosol as inactive heterodimers composed of p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1). Phosphorylation of both the threonine and the serine residue is required to fully activate AKT. The active AKT then dissociates from PIP3 and phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins that play important roles in cell survival and metabolism. For a recent review of AKT signaling, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007.

EGFR L861Q 	Protein	P00533	Uniprot-TrEMBL	L861Q, a substitution of leucine 861 with glutamine, is a documented EGFR mutation in the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Leu861, encoded by exon 21, localizes to the N-terminal portion of the activation loop (A loop) of the kinase domain of EGFR and together with Leu858 participates in hydrophobic interactions that keep the kinase in the inactive conformation (Zhang et al. 2006). Replacement of Leu861 with glutamine is expected to destabilize the inactive conformation of EGFR and result in constitutive catalytic activity (Zhang et al. 2006). NSCLCs harboring L861Q mutation in EGFR are responsive to small EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors from the 4-anilinoquinazoline group gefitinib (Lynch et al. 2004) and are expected to be responsive to the related drug, erlotinib.

EGFR L858R 	Protein	P00533	Uniprot-TrEMBL	L858R, a substitution of leucine 858 with arginine, accounts for ~40% of EGFR mutations in the non-small-cell lung cancer. L858R, encoded by exon 21, localizes to the N-terminal portion of the activation loop (A loop) of the kinase domain of EGFR. By locking the EGFR in its active conformation, L858R mutation results in constitutive catalytic activity of EGFR which is ~50-fold higher than the activity of the wild-type enzyme (Yun et al. 2007). The L858R EGFR mutant is inhibited by binding of small EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors from the 4-anilinoquinazoline group, erlotinib and gefitinib, as well as the pyrrolopyrimidine compound AEE788. Gefitinib is ~100-fold more potent against the L858R mutant than against the wild-type EGFR kinase (Yun et al. 2007). Erlotinib (Pao et al. 2004) and AEE788 (Yun et al. 2007) are also more efficient in inhibiting the L858R mutant than the wild-type EGFR.

RAF/MAP kinase
cascade	Pathway	R-HSA-5673001	Reactome	The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway regulates processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence and cell motility in response to growth factors, hormones and cytokines, among others. Binding of these stimuli to receptors in the plasma membrane promotes the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and initiates the three-tiered kinase cascade of the conventional MAPK cascades.  GTP-bound RAS recruits RAF (the MAPK kinase kinase), and promotes its dimerization and activation (reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014; Roskoski, 2010; McKay and Morrison, 2007; Wellbrock et al, 2004).  Activated RAF phosphorylates the MAPK kinase proteins MEK1 and MEK2 (also known as MAP2K1 and MAP2K2), which in turn phophorylate the proline-directed kinases ERK1 and 2 (also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1) (reviewed in Roskoski, 2012a, b; Kryiakis and Avruch, 2012).  Activated ERK proteins may undergo dimerization and have identified targets in both the nucleus and the cytosol; consistent with this, a proportion of activated ERK protein relocalizes to the nucleus in response to stimuli (reviewed in Roskoski 2012b; Turjanski et al, 2007; Plotnikov et al, 2010; Cargnello et al, 2011).  Although initially seen as a linear cascade originating at the plasma membrane and culminating in the nucleus, the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is now also known to be activated from various intracellular location.  Temporal and spatial specificity of the cascade is achieved in part through the interaction of pathway components with numerous scaffolding proteins (reviewed in McKay and Morrison, 2007; Brown and Sacks, 2009). <br> The importance of the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is highlighted by the fact that components of this pathway are mutated with high frequency in a large number of human cancers.  Activating mutations in RAS are found in approximately one third of human cancers, while ~8% of tumors express an activated form of BRAF (Roberts and Der, 2007; Davies et al, 2002; Cantwell-Dorris et al, 2011).

EGFR L861Q 	Protein	P00533	Uniprot-TrEMBL	L861Q, a substitution of leucine 861 with glutamine, is a documented EGFR mutation in the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Leu861, encoded by exon 21, localizes to the N-terminal portion of the activation loop (A loop) of the kinase domain of EGFR and together with Leu858 participates in hydrophobic interactions that keep the kinase in the inactive conformation (Zhang et al. 2006). Replacement of Leu861 with glutamine is expected to destabilize the inactive conformation of EGFR and result in constitutive catalytic activity (Zhang et al. 2006). NSCLCs harboring L861Q mutation in EGFR are responsive to small EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors from the 4-anilinoquinazoline group gefitinib (Lynch et al. 2004) and are expected to be responsive to the related drug, erlotinib.

EGFR L858R 	Protein	P00533	Uniprot-TrEMBL	L858R, a substitution of leucine 858 with arginine, accounts for ~40% of EGFR mutations in the non-small-cell lung cancer. L858R, encoded by exon 21, localizes to the N-terminal portion of the activation loop (A loop) of the kinase domain of EGFR. By locking the EGFR in its active conformation, L858R mutation results in constitutive catalytic activity of EGFR which is ~50-fold higher than the activity of the wild-type enzyme (Yun et al. 2007). The L858R EGFR mutant is inhibited by binding of small EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors from the 4-anilinoquinazoline group, erlotinib and gefitinib, as well as the pyrrolopyrimidine compound AEE788. Gefitinib is ~100-fold more potent against the L858R mutant than against the wild-type EGFR kinase (Yun et al. 2007). Erlotinib (Pao et al. 2004) and AEE788 (Yun et al. 2007) are also more efficient in inhibiting the L858R mutant than the wild-type EGFR.
