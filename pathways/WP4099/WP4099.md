description: 'Five modified nucleotides have been detected in the 12S rRNA: 5-methylcytidine-841
  catalyzed by NSUN4, 6-dimethyladenosine-936 catalyzed by TFB1M, 6-dimethyladenosine-937
  catalyzed by TFB1M,  5-methyluridine-429, and 4-methylcytidine-839 (reviewed in
  Van Haute et al. 2015). Four modified nucleotides have been detected in 16S rRNA:
  2''-O-methylguanosine-1145 catalyzed by MRM1, 2''-O-methylguanosine-1370 catalyzed
  by RNMTL1 (MRM3), 2''-O-methyluridine-1369 catalyzed by FTSJ2 (MRM2), and pseudouridine-1397.
  2''-O-methyluridine-1369 and 2''-O-methylguanosone-1370 occur in the A-loop of rRNA
  which is located at the peptidyl transferase center of the large subunit. Here the
  modified residues play a role in interaction with the aminoacyl site of tRNA. Knockouts
  of TFB1M and NSUN4 are lethal in mice and mutations in TFB1M may be related to aminoglycoside-induced
  deafness (reviewed in Van Haute et al. 2015).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6793080
