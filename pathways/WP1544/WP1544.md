description: This pathway shows the role of microRNAs in the process of cardiac hypertrophy.
  MicroRNA targets were predicted by the TargetScan algorithm, and the predicted interactions
  are shown in red dashed lines. MicroRNAs are shown as purple rounded rectangles.
  It is not sure which WNT and frizzled proteins influence cardiac hypertrophy. Though
  there are strong indications that WNT3A, WNT5A, frizzled1 and frizzled2 play a role
  in cardiac hypertrophy. Thus these have been added to the pathway instead of all
  the WNT and frizzled proteins. Experiments which will shed light on this are still
  being done.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1544
