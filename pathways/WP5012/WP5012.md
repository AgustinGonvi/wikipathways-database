description: 'The liver X receptors LXRÎ± (NR1H3) and LXRÎ² (NR1H2) are members of
  the nuclear receptor superfamily and function as ligand-activated transcription
  factors. The natural ligands of NR1H2 and NR1H3 are oxysterols (e.g., 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol,
  24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (OH), 25-OH, and 27-OH) that are produced endogenously
  by enzymatic reactions, by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent oxidation of
  cholesterol and by the alimentary processes (reviewed in:Jakobsson T et al. 2012;
  Huang C 2014; Komati R et al. 2017). It has been shown that these oxysterols bind
  directly to the ligand-binding domain of LXRs with Kd values ranging from 0.1 to
  0.4â€ŠmicroM. 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol was found to be the most potent endogenous
  agonist (Janowski BA et al. 1999). NR1H3 (LXRÎ±) and NR1H2 (LXRÎ²) showed similar
  affinities for these compounds (Janowski BA et al. 1999). In physiological conditions,
  oxysterols are formed in amounts proportional to cholesterol content in the cell
  and therefore the LXRs operate as cholesterol sensors to alter gene expression and
  protect the cells from cholesterol overload via: (1) inhibiting intestinal cholesterol
  absorption; (2) stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoproteins
  through the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1: (3) activating the
  conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver; and (4) activating biliary
  cholesterol and bile acid excretion (reviewed in: WÃ³jcicka G et al. 2007; Baranowski
  M 2008; Laurencikiene J & RydÃ©n M 2012; Edwards PA et al. 2002; Zelcer N & Tontonoz
  P 2006; Zhao C & Dahlman-Wright K 2010). In addition, LXR agonists enhance de novo
  fatty acid synthesis by stimulating the expression of a lipogenic transcription
  factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), leading to the
  elevation of plasma triglycerides and hepatic steatosis (WÃ³jcicka G et al. 2007;
  Baranowski M 2008; Laurencikiene J & RydÃ©n M 2012). In addition to their function
  in lipid metabolism, NR1H2,3 have also been found to modulate immune and inflammatory
  responses in macrophages (Zelcer N & Tontonoz P 2006). The NR1H2 and NR1H3 molecules
  can be viewed as having four functional domains: (1) an amino-terminal ligand-independent
  activation function domain (AF-1), which may stimulate transcription in the absence
  of ligand; (2) a DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing two zinc fingers; (3) a hydrophobic
  ligand-binding domain (LBD) required for ligand binding and receptor dimerization;
  and, (4) a carboxy-terminal ligand-dependent transactivation sequence (also referred
  to as the activation function-2 (AF-2) domain) that stimulates transcription in
  response to ligand binding (Robinson-Rechavi M et al. 2003; Jakobsson T et al. 2012;
  FÃ¤rnegardh M et al. 2003; Lin CY & Gustafsson JA 2015). Although both NR1H3 and
  NR1H2 are activated by the same ligands and are structurally similar, their tissue
  expression profiles are very different. NR1H3 is selectively expressed in specific
  tissues and cell types, such as the liver, intestine, adrenal gland, adipose tissue
  and macrophages, whereas NR1H2 is ubiquitously expressed (Nishimura M et al. 2004;
  Bookout AL et al. 2006). Upon activation NR1H2 or NR1H3 heterodimerizes with retinoid
  X receptors (RXR) and binds to LXR-response elements (LXREs) consisting of a direct
  repeat of the core sequence 5''-AGGTCA-3'' separated by 4 nucleotides (DR4) in the
  DNA of target genes (Wiebel FF & Gustafsson JA 1997). An inverted repeat of the
  same consensus sequence with no spacer region(IR-0) and an inverted repeat of the
  same consensus sequence separated by a 1 bp spacer (IR-1) have also been shown to
  mediate LXR transactivation (Mak PA et al. 2002, Landrier JF et al. 2003). NR1H3
  and NR1H2 have been shown to regulate gene expression via LXREs in the promoter
  regions of their target genes such as UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide
  A3 (UGT1A3) (Verreault M et al. 2006), fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Joseph SB et al.
  2002a), carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP, also known as MLX-interacting
  protein-like or MLXIPL) (Cha JY & Repa JJ 2007) and phospholipid transfer protein
  (PLTP) (Mak PA et al. 2002). LXREs have also been reported to be present in introns
  of target genes such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) (Sabol SL
  et al. 2005). NR1H3 has been shown to activate gene expression via the FXR-responsive
  element found in the proximal promoter of the human ileal bile acid-binding protein
  (FABP6) (Landrier JF et al. 2003). The NR1H2,3:RXR heterodimers are permissive,
  in that they can be activated by ligands for either NR1H2,3 (LXR) or RXR (Willy
  PJ et al. 1995).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9024446
