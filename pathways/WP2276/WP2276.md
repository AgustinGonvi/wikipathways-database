description: 'Glial cells, consisting of microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte
  lineage cells as their major components, constitute a large fraction of the mammalian
  brain. Originally considered as purely non-functional glue for neurons, decades
  of research have highlighted the importance as well as further functions of glial
  cells. Source: https://dx.doi.org/10.3389%2Ffncel.2017.00024.  Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2276
