description: Axl is a transmembrane protein comes under TAM (Tyro3,Axl and Mertk)
  family of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). It is first identified as transforming
  gene, isolated from primary human myeloid leukemia cells. Axl gene is located in
  chromosome 19, at 19q13.1 , which encodes 894 amino acids with molecular weight
  range between 100 and 140kDa. Axl receptor is having extracellular, transmembrane
  and an intracellular domain. Extra cellular domain contains two immunoglobulin like
  (IgL) and fibronectin type-III (FN III) like domain with a single pass transmembrane
  domain. An intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain contains total six phosphorylation
  sites, among them three phosphorylation sites were found in N-terminal domain such
  as Tyr 779 , Tyr 821 and Tyr 866 and other three sites were found in C-terminal
  domain such as Tyr 698 , Tyr 702 , Tyr 703 which are getting autophosphorlyated
  to accomplish their complete functions of subsequent kinase activity. Axl activation
  is mediated by a ligand growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6). The activation
  of Axl can also occur through ligand independent in response to ROS which mainly
  occurs during oxidative stress and overexpression of Axl. Axl receptor is extensively
  expressed in various tissues such as brain, heart, liver, bone marrow, neurons and
  vascular tissues. The aberrant expression as well as prolonged activation of Axl
  has been reported in various disease conditions such as cancer, chronic immune disorders
  and cardiovascular diseases. The Axl receptor is a class of protein that transfer
  signals from the extracellular matrix into the cytoplasm and results in various
  signaling pathways through its downstream substrates. This regulates various physiological
  processes including cell proliferation, survival, motility, aggregation and anti-inflammation.
  The Axl receptor activation contributes various down signaling pathways including
  PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, JAK/STAT, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Axl ligand independent activation
  also induces AKT and MAPK signaling pathways and regulates EMT, which are mainly
  involved in cell proliferation, migration and survival of colorectal cancer. However,
  it has a major concern in biomedical importance, comprehensive detail about Axl
  mediated signaling pathway is still unavailable in the publically available pathway
  resources. Therefore, we systematically developed an integrated pathway map of Axl
  signaling. The pathway map was developed through literature mining from published
  literature data based on manual annotation guidelines adapted from Netpath (curated
  resource of signal transduction pathways in humans). In the present study, PubMed
  search using query terms showed about 1170 articles, which were related to Axl signaling
  pathway until November 2019. These articles were carefully reviewed based on our
  annotation criteria and short listed into 171 articles which had information pertinent
  to Axl mediated signaling.
