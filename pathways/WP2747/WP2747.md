description: 'Phosphatidylinositol (PI), a membrane phospholipid, can be reversibly
  phosphorylated at the 3, 4, and 5 positions of the inositol ring to generate seven
  phosphoinositides: phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), phosphatidylinositol
  4-phosphate (PI4P), phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), phosphatidylinositol
  3,4-bisphosphate PI(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol
  3,5-bisphosphate PI(3,5)P2, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3).
  These seven phosphoinositides, which are heterogeneously distributed within cells,
  can serve as signature components of different intracellular compartment membranes
  and so help to mediate specificity of membrane interactions. Phosphoinositide levels
  are tightly regulated spatially and temporally by the action of various kinases
  and phosphatases whilst PI(4,5)P2 is also a substrate for phospholipase C. The differential
  localisation of each of these enzymes on specific compartment membranes ensures
  maintenance of the heterogeneous distribution of phosphoinositides despite the continuous
  membrane flow from one compartment to another.<br><br>PI is primarily synthesised
  in the endoplasmic reticulum from where the phospholipid is exported to other compartments
  via membrane traffic or via cytosolic phospholipid transfer proteins. Phosphorylation
  of PI to PI4P primarily occurs in the Golgi, where PI4P plays an important role
  in the biogenesis of transport vesicles such as the secretory vesicle involved in
  its transport to the plasma membrane. At this place, PI4P has a major function acting
  as a precursor of PI(4,5)P2, which is located predominantly at this membrane. PI(4,5)P2
  binds and regulates a wide range of proteins that function on the cell surface and
  serves as a precursor for second messengers. Additionally, it helps define this
  membrane as a target for secretory vesicles, functions as a coreceptor in endocytic
  processes, and functions as a cofactor for actin nucleation.<br><br>At the plasma
  membrane, PI(4,5)P2 is further phosphorylated to PI(3,4,5)P3, another phosphoinositide
  with important signalling functions including stimulating cell survival and proliferation.
  The inositol 3-phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) regenerates PI(4,5)P2,
  while the 5-phosphatases convert PI(3,4,5)P3 into the phosphoinositide, PI(3,4)P2,
  propagating the signal initiated by PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4)P2 is further dephosphorylated
  in the endocytic pathway by inositol 4-phosphatases to PI3P, the signature phosphoinositide
  of the early endosomal compartment and a ligand for numerous endosomal proteins.
  However, the bulk of PI3P is generated directly in the endosomes by phosphorylation
  of PI. The subsequent endosomal phosphorylation of PI3P to PI(3,5)P2 is believed
  to generate docking sites for recruitment of cytosolic factors responsible for the
  control of outgoing traffic from the endosomes. The main localisation and function
  of the low abundance phosphoinositide PI5P, that can be generated by several pathways,
  remains to be determined (Krauss & Haucke 2007, Leventis & Grinstein 2010, Roth
