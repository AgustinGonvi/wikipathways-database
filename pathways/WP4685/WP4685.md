description: Melanoma, or malignant melanoma, is a highly aggressive cancer that develops
  in melanocytes. Many genes have been found to be mutated or amplified in melanoma,
  with the most commonly mutated genes being BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53. MAPK and
  PI3K/Akt signaling are central to melanoma.   This pathway is a summary of information
  from figures 1 and 2 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520749/
  Kunz and Vera] and supplemented with information from [https://www.kegg.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa05218
  KEGG].   CDKN2A is frequently mutated in melanoma and germline mutations are associated
  with an increased susceptibility of developing skin cancer. The CDKN2A encodes two
  proteins, p16 (INK4A) and p14ARF, with different functions. p16 binds to CDK4, which
  prevents phosphorylation of Rb, thereby controlling the G1 to S transition. Without
  functioning p16, G1 to S transition can proceed. p14ARF is central to cell cycle
  regulation, inhibiting MDM2, which normally degrades p53, so loss of p14ARF has
  a similar effect to loss of p53.
