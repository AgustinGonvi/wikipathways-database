description: 'This pathway is giving a summary of currently known nanoparticle effects
  on cells and organisms. Although there is currently no nanoparticle-specific effect
  known, there is a cascade of effects triggered if cells or organisms are exposed
  to nanoparticles: The most abundantly observed event is oxidative stress which causes
  DNA damage, protein and lipid oxidation, and cell death. The mere overload of nanoparticles
  in the vesicular system leads to cytoskeleton and cell adhesion problems and interfere
  with the cell''s autophagic system. Some specific nanoparticles are reported to
  interfere with the cell membrane, others stimulate the blood coagulation system.
  The release of metal ions from specific nanoparticles challenges the metal disposal
  system of the cell.'
