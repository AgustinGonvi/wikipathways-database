description: The major pathway of histidine catabolism, annotated here, proceeds in four steps to yield glutamate and, in the process, convert one molecule of tetrahydrofolate to 5-formiminotetrahydrofolate (Morris et al. 1972). Histidine can also be decarboxylated to form histamine. Histidine can also be used to form carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine), an abundant dipeptide in skeletal muscle and brain of most vertebrates.
