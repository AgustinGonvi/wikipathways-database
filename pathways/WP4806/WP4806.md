description: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are drugs that inhibit the phosphorylation,
  and subsequent activation, of tyrosine kinases. TKIs are typically used as cancer
  therapeutics, but development of resistance to TKIs in cancers is common. This pathway
  describes several mechanisms of TKI resistance in the context of EGFR signaling.
  Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, EGFR, is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that
  binds to the EGF-family of ligands. It activates several downstream signaling cascades,
  including MAPK, and leads to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Mutations and
  over-expression in EGFR is implicated in many cancers.  The section of the pathway
  outlined in pink corresponds to mechanisms of TKI resistance.
