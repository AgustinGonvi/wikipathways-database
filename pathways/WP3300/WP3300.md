description: By hijacking CBF-b, Vif (Viral infectivity factor, HIV protein) is manipulating
  the ubquitination machinery and adversely effecting host transcriptional regulation.
  This pathways was adapted from figure 3 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23352243
  Fraser et al]. Viral proteins are highlighted in yellow.
