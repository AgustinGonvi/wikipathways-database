  "description": "Feline McDonough Sarcoma-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) (also known as FLK2 (fetal liver tyrosine kinase 2), STK-1 (stem cell tyrosine kinase 1) or CD135) is a member of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family involved in the differentiation, proliferation and survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells and of dendritic cells. Upon FLT3 ligand (FL) binding, the receptor forms dimers and is phosphorylated. Consequently, adapter and signaling molecules bind with the active receptor and trigger the activation of various pathways downstream including PI3K/Akt and MAPK cascades (Grafone T et al. 2012).
