Description: The network features protein-protein interactions related to seed development in rice. Co-expression information for some genes known to be important for seed development is also shown.  The Gene Basket contains a few genes/proteins that are known to be important for the process but for which interactions were unknown or intentionally left out when the network was created. Please go ahead and move them into the network if you find the correct interacting partner(s).
