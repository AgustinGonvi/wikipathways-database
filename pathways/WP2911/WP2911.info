Description: Based on the KEGG ECM-receptor interactions pathway (hsa04512), a depiction a plausible mechanism, where miRNAs regulate components of both extracellular matrix (top panel) and transmembrane receptors (bottom panel) to mediate cell-to-cell communications.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2911 CPTAC Assay Portal].
