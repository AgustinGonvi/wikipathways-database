  differentiation at a glance, Arkady Rutkovskiy, Kåre-Olav Stensløkken, Ingvar Jarle

  skeleton by Fanxin Long, David Ornitz [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23284041].  Mesenchymal
  stem cells can give rise to 4 lineages by expressing corresponding transcriptional
  regulators: PPARg for adipogenic, MyoD for myogenic, Runx2 for osteoblastic, and
  Sox9 for chondrocytic lineages. In intramembranous ossification (osteogenesis in
  the scull and clavicles), preosteoblasts stem directly from mesenchymal stem cells,
  while in endochondral (osteogenesis of the axial skeleton and the limbs) a common
  osteo-chondro progenitor gives rise to both cell types.  Extracellular signals regulating
  osteoblast differentiation: Model is based on studies of the mouse limb skeleton.
  Osteoblasts differentiate from mesenchymal progenitors (MP) through distinct developmental
  stages marked by expression of key transcription factors including SOX9, RUNX2,
  and OSX. Mature osteoblasts (OB) can further differentiate to osteocytes (OCY) or
  bone lining cells (not depicted) or undergo apoptosis (not depicted).  Indian hedgehog
  (IHH) signaling is required for osteoblast differentiation during endochondral bone
  development. IHH binding to the receptor Patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) activates signaling
  through Smoothened (SMO), thereby inhibiting the generation of the proteolytically
  cleaved GLI3 repressor (GLI3R) and promoting the generation of the full-length GLI2
  activator (GLI2A). Whereas derepression of GLI3R is sufficient to generate RUNX2+
  cells, both derepression of GLI3R and activation of GLI2A are necessary for progression
  to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage. NOTCH signaling inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Following
  binding to their ligands, Jagged (JAG) or Delta-like (DLL), Notch receptors are
  proteolytically cleaved by the g-secretase complex, leading to release of the Notch
  intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. NICD interacts with RBPJk
  and together they activate downstream target genes, including HES (Hairy and Enhancer
  of Split) and HEY (HES-related with YRPW motif) family transcription factors, ultimately
  leading to inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, seemingly at a stage before
  OSX activation.  WNT signaling promotes osteoblast differentiation. During b-catenin-dependent
  WNT signaling, b-catenin is stabilized following binding of WNT to its receptors
  Frizzled (FZD) and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) or LRP6, leading
  to the transcription of b-catenin target genes and ultimately stimulating progression
  from the RUNX2+ stage to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage, and from RUNX2+OSX+ cells to mature
  osteoblasts. WNTcan also signal independently of LRP5/6 and b-catenin through protein
  kinase Cd (PKCd), promoting progression to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage through an unknown
  mechanism.  Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling stimulates osteoblast differentiation
  and function. Binding of BMP2 or BMP4 to their receptors results in phosphorylation
  of SMAD1, SMAD5, or SMAD8. These can then form a complex with their partner, SMAD4,
  and enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression, ultimately promoting the transition
  to RUNX2+OSX+ cells and enhancing the function of mature osteoblasts; however, a
  direct role for SMAD signaling in osteoblast differentiation remains to be shown.  Fibroblast
  growth factor (FGF) signaling has diverse roles in osteoblast lineage cells. FGFs
  function by binding to cell surface Tyr kinase FGF receptors (FGFR1–FGFR4 in humans
  and mice), leading to the activation of multiple signaling modules. FGF signaling
  regulates preosteoblast proliferation and osteoblast differentiation, as well as
  the function of mature osteoblasts. However, the precise stages at which FGFs regulate
  proliferation and differentiation, and the intracellular signaling cascades responsible
  for each function, remain to be elucidated. BMPR, BMP receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; STAT1, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 1.  Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases
  caused by mutation in the respective gene.'
