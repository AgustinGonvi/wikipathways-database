description: SMARCB1 is a core subunit proteins of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
  complex, which interact with transcription factors at promoters and enhancers to
  modulate gene expression. Renal medullary carcinomas have been found to be deficient
  in SMARCB1 (BAF47) due to mutations. This pathway represents a summary of target
  genes and pathways implicated in the tumor suppression activity of SMARCB1.   This
  pathway is modeled after figure 2 of "Oncogenic roles of SMARCB1/INI1 and its deficient
  tumors" by Kohashi and Oda, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28109176. Inactivating
  mutation of SMARCB1 in renal medullary carcinoma is indicated.  Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4204
