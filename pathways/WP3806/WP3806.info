description: Folates are essential cofactors that provide one-carbon moieties in various states of reduction for biosynthetic reactions. Processes annotated here include transport reactions by which folates are taken up by cells and moved intracellularly, folate conjugation with glutamate (required for folate retention within a cell), and some of the key reactions in the generation of reduced folates and one-carbon derivatives of folate.
