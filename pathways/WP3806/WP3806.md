description: Folates are essential cofactors that provide one-carbon moieties in various
  states of reduction for biosynthetic reactions. Processes annotated here include
  transport reactions by which folates are taken up by cells and moved intracellularly,
  folate conjugation with glutamate (required for folate retention within a cell),
  and some of the key reactions in the generation of reduced folates and one-carbon
  derivatives of folate.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=196757
