description: The effect of progerin on the involved genes in HGPS. Each coloured box
  shows a different element of the pathway. The red box on the upper right shows that
  upregulation of the p53 pathway leads to apoptosis and senescence. The box beneath
  the red one, the purple one, indicates the inhibition of the Wnt pathway by progerin
  which results in bone abnormalities. The blue box portraits the epigenetic changes
  done by heterochromatin and euchromatin silencing. The green box shows that progerin
  activates SKIP which stimulates the Notch signaling pathway. The orange box surrounds
  the Mi-2/NuRD complex which is depleted by progerin leading mainly to epigenetic
  changes. The final yellow box shows the inhibition of SERBP1 by progerin resulting
  in dysfunctional adipose tissue. Legend shows basic and MIM-interactions and indication
  for methylation.
