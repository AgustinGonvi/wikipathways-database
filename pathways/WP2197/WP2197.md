description: Endothelin-1 is a bicyclic 21 amino acid peptide, produced primarily
  in the endothelium. It is a potent stimulus of long-lasting and persistent vasoconstriction.
  It also has a role as a stimulus of inflammation, oxidative stress and cellular
  proliferation.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the
