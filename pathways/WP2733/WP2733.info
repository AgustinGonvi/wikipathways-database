description: RNA elements rich in adenine and uracil residues (AU-rich elements) bind specific proteins which either target the RNA for degradation or, more rarely, stabilize the RNA. The activity of the AU-element binding proteins is regulated, usually by phosphorylation but also by subcellular localization.
