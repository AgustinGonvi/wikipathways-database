  "description": "Scavenger receptors bind free extracellular ligands as the initial step in clearance of the ligands from the body (reviewed in Ascenzi et al. 2005, Areschoug and Gordon 2009, Nielsen et al. 2010). Some scavenger receptors, such as the CD163-haptoglobin system, are specific for only one ligand. Others, such as the SCARA receptors (SR-A receptors) are less specific, binding several ligands which share a common property, such as polyanionic charges.<br>Brown and Goldstein originated the idea of receptors dedicated to scavenging aberrant molecules such as modified low density lipoprotein particles (Goldstein et al. 1979) and such receptors have been shown to participate in pathological processes such as atherosclerosis. Based on homology, scavenger receptors have been categorized into classes A-H (reviewed in Murphy et al. 2005).
