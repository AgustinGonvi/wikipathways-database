LDLRAP1	Protein	Q5SW96	Uniprot-TrEMBL	AKA Low density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1; ARH1</br>"Adapter protein (clathrin-associated sorting protein (CLASP)) required for efficient endocytosis of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in polarized cells such as hepatocytes and lymphocytes, but not in non-polarized cells (fibroblasts). May be required for LDL binding and internalization but not for receptor clustering in coated pits. May facilitate the endocytocis of LDLR and LDLR-LDL complexes from coated pits by stabilizing the interaction between the receptor and the structural components of the pits. May also be involved in the internalization of other LDLR family members." [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q5SW96]

B48	Protein	A8MUN2	Uniprot-TrEMBL	"Apolipoprotein B(apo B) occurs in the plasma in 2 main isoforms, ApoB48 and ApoB100. ApoB48 is generated when a stop codon (UAA) is created by RNA editing.

As a result of the RNA editing, ApoB48 and ApoB100 share a common N-terminal sequence, but ApoB48 lacks ApoB100's C-terminal LDL receptor binding region. In fact, ApoB48 is so called because it constitutes 48% of the sequence for ApoB100.

ApoB 48 is a unique protein to chylomicrons from the small intestine. After most of the lipids in the chylomicron have been absorbed, ApoB48 returns to the liver as part of the chylomicron remnant, where it is endocytosed and degraded."
