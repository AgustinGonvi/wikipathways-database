description: This pathway shows genetic disorders related to lipoprotein metabolism.
  Two plasmalipoproteins, LDL and HDL, and one plasma lipid, triglyceride (TG), play
  an important role in this pathway. Hydrophobic lipids and fat-soluble vitamins are
  normally transported to the site of their uptake by transporters called lipoproteins,
  and any deregulation of the plasma concentrations of these proteins can cause dyslipidemias.
  Disorders resulting from an enzyme deficiency are highlighted in pink. More details
  on the composition of the various lipoproteins in this pathway are visualised in
  [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP3601].  This pathway was inspired
  by Chapter 43 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).

  - As a result of the RNA editing, ApoB48 and ApoB100 share a common N-terminal sequence,
    but ApoB48 lacks ApoB100's C-terminal LDL receptor binding region. In fact, ApoB48
    is so called because it constitutes 48% of the sequence for ApoB100.
