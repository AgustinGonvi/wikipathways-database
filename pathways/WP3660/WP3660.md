description: Pathways regulating Drosophila's humoral response to bacterial and fungal
  pathogens. Pathogens such as fungal B-1-3-glucans and virulence factors illicit
  signalling pathways through receptors on body fat cells of Drosophila Melanogaster
  (Protein Toll, PGRP-LC, and Domeless). The activation of receptors initiates pathways
  that increase transcription of antimicrobial agents and thioester proteins. This
  pathway is based on figure 1 from Igboin et al.
