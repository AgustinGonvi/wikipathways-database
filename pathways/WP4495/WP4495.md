description: IL-10 Anti-inflammatory Signaling Pathway. Pathway based on Biocarta
  pathway (M6778). https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta/h_il10Pathway  IL-10
  binds to its respective IL-10 receptor which activates the JAK/STAT pathway and
  MAPK pathway involving the p38 kinases. This leads to the induction of the enzyme
  heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) which is involved in the biosynthesis of heme, and catalyzes
  the reaction producing the heme precursor biliverdin. The ani-inflammatory actions
  of HMOX appear to be the result of signaling by carbon monoxide which inhibits pro-inflammatory
  cytokine production.
