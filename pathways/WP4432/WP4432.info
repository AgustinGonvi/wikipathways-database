description: Estrogens are a class of hormones that play a role in physiological processes such as development, reproduction, metabolism of liver, fat and bone, and neuronal and cardiovascular function (reviewed in Arnal et al, 2017; Haldosen et al, 2014). Estrogens bind estrogen receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Ligand-bound estrogen receptors act as nuclear transcription factors to regulate expression of genes that control cellular proliferation and differentiation, among other processes, but also play a non-genomic role in rapid signaling from the plasma membrane (reviewed in Hah et al, 2014;Schwartz et al, 2016).
