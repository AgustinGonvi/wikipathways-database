  "description": "Semaphorins are a large family of cell surface and secreted guidance molecules divided into eight classes on the basis of their structures. They all have an N-terminal conserved sema domain. Semaphorins signal through multimeric receptor complexes that include other proteins such as plexins and neuropilins.
