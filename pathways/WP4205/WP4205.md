description: MET activation by its ligand HGF induces MET kinase catalytic activity,
  which triggers transphosphorylation of Tyr1234 and Tyr1235. These two tyrosines
  engage various signal transducers, thus initiating a whole spectrum of biological
  activities driven by MET, collectively known as the invasive growth program; proliferation
  and survival (resistance to apoptotic signals), increased cell motility, cell dissociation
  (scattering), epithelial tubulogenesis, infiltration of tissues, and stimulation
  of angiogenesis (Appleman et al). The transducers interact with the intracellular
  multisubstrate docking site of MET either directly, such as GRB2, SHC, SRC, and
  the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, or indirectly through the scaffolding protein
  GAB1. Phosphorylation of Tyr1349 and Tyr1356 of the multisubstrate docking site
  mediates interaction with GAB1, SRC, and SHC, while only Tyr 1356 is involved in
  the recruitment of GRB2, phospholipase C γ (PLC-γ), p85, and SHP2.  GAB1 is a key
  coordinator of the cellular responses to MET and binds the MET intracellular region
  with high avidity, but low affinity. Upon interaction with MET, GAB1 becomes phosphorylated
  on several tyrosine residues which, in turn, recruit a number of signaling effectors,
  including PI3K, SHP2, and PLC-γ. GAB1 phosphorylation by MET results in a sustained
  signal that mediates most of the downstream signaling pathways. (Description adapted
  from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-Met Wikipedia]). MET is a proto-oncogene,
  meaning that regulated expression of the wild-type allele plays a role in normal
  physiologic processes, and malignant transformation occurs when MET activity is
  increased in- appropriately and/or constitutively activated (Appleman et al).
