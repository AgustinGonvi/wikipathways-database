description: Carnitine is synthesized in four steps from trimethyllysine (generated
  in turn by the S-adenosyl-methionine-mediated methylation of lysine residues in
  proteins, followed by protein hydrolysis). The enzymes that catalyze the first three
  steps of carnitine synthesis, converting trimethyllysine to gamma-butyrobetaine,
  are widely distributed in human tissues. The enzyme that catalyzes the last reaction,
  converting gamma-butyrobetaine to carnitine, is found only in liver and kidney cells,
  and at very low levels in brain tissues. Other tissues that require carnitine, such
  as muscle, are dependent on transport systems that mediate its export from the liver
  and uptake by other tissues (Bremer 1983, Kerner and Hoppel 1998).  View original
