  "description": "This phospholipid biosynthesis shows a schematic outline of the major pathways for phospholipid biosynthesis in yeast, including the phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidyl- ethanolamine (PC/PE) reacylation pathways and the glycerophosphocholine acyltransferase (GPCAT) and glycerophosphoethanolamine acyltransferase (GPEAT) activities described in the present paper. CL, cardiolipin; DAG, diacylglycerol; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phos- phate; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; GPC, glycerophosphocholine; GPE, glycerophosphoethanolamine; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine.",
