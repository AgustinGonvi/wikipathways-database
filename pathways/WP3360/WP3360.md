description: Diphtheria is a serious, often fatal human disease associated with damage
  to many tissues. Bacteria in infected individuals, however, are typically confined
  to the lining of the throat or to a skin lesion; systemic effects are due to the
  secretion of an exotoxin encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage. The toxin is encoded
  as a single polypeptide but is cleaved by host furin-like proteases to yield an
  aminoterminal fragment A and a carboxyterminal fragment B, linked by a disulfide
  bond. Toxin cleavage can occur when it first contacts the target cell surface, as
  annotated here, or as late as the point at which fragment A is released into the
  cytosol. Fragment B mediates toxin uptake into target cell endocytic vesicles, where
  acidification promotes a conformational change enabling fragment B to form a channel
  in the vesicle membrane through which fragment A is extruded into the target cell
  cytosol. Cleavage of the inter-fragment disulfide bond frees DT fragment A, which
  catalyzes ADP ribosylation of the translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) in a target
  cell, thereby blocking protein synthesis. Neither fragment is toxic to human cells
  by itself (Collier 1975; Pappenheim 1977; Murphy 2011).  View original pathway at
