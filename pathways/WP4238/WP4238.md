description: 'Proposed metabolic pathway of flavan-3-ols (also known as flavanols)
  in humans. Flavanols are derivatives of flavans and include catechin, epicatechin
  gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, proanthocyanidins, theaflavins,
  thearubigins.  These compounds differ considerably not only in their structural
  and functional properties, but also in their metabolism and bioavailability. Green
  arrows indicate microbiota-mediated steps, and Red arrows represent mammalian enzyme-mediated
  conversions. Pink arrows indicate steps that can be both microbiota- or enzyme-mediated.
  This pathway was developed based upon 22 papers, therefore black arrows indicate
  missing information regarding the nature of conversion. Acknowledgements: This pathway
  is based upon work from COST Action POSITIVe, supported by COST (European Cooperation
  in Science and Technology.'
