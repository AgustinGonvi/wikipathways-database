description: Interleukin 17 is a family of cytokines that acts as potent mediators
  in delayed-type reactions by increasing chemokine production in various tissues
  to recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of inflammation, similar to Interferon
  gamma. IL-17 is produced by T-helper cells and is induced by IL-23 which results
  in destructive tissue damage in delayed-type reactions. Interleukin 17 as a family
  functions as proinflammatory cytokines that responds to the invasion of the immune
  system by extracellular pathogens. Interleukin 17 acts synergistically with tumor
  necrosis factor and interleukin-1.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2112 CPTAC
  Assay Portal]
