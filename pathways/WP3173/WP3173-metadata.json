  "description": "The recently identified type III interferon group consists of three IFN-\u03bb (lambda) genes encoding molecules called IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 (also called IL29, IL28A and IL28B respectively). These IFNs signal through a receptor complex consisting of IL10R2 (also called CRF2-4) and IFNLR1 (also called CRF2-12).",
