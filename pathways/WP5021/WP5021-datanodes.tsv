UVRAG complex	Complex	R-HSA-5683632	Reactome	The PIK3C3-containing Beclin-1 complex consists of PIK3C3 (Vps34), BECN1 (Beclin-1, Atg6), PIK3R4 (p150, Vps15) and ATG14 (Barkor) (Matsunaga et al. 2009, Zhong et al. 2009). A similar complex where ATG14 is replaced by UVRAG functions later in autophagosome maturation and endocytic traffic (Itakura et al. 2008, Liang et al. 2008). Binding of KIAA0226 to this complex negatively regulates the maturation process (Matsunaga et al. 2009).
