description: This pathway describes the induction and modulation of the human autophagy
  system during human coronavirus infection. The information is based on the review
  of Fung and Liu [10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759]. Autophagy is usually a stress
  mediated defense mechanism and can protect against pathogen infection. On the other
  hand it is known from several viruses that they can hijack the cellular autophagy
  system for proliferation [10.1074/jbc.M306124200]. For human coronaviruses it is
  presumed that coronaviruses stimulate the initiation of autophagy due to infection
  initiated stress for which PIK3R4 (VPS15), PIK3C3 (VPS34) and BECN1 (beclin1) are
  key proteins. Additionally, nsp6 (and nsp567 from other virus species than SARS-CoV)
  inhibit maturation of autolysosomes. Nsp6 is involved in the formation of double
  membrane vesicles and therefore has side effects on the formation of normal cellular
  vesicles [10.4161/auto.29309].
