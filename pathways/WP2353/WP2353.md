description: Tetrahydrofolate (THF) acts as a carrier for one-carbon units and, less
  often, as an electron donor. THF contains pterin, p-aminobenzoate, and glutamate
  moieties. The pterin is made in the cytosol from GTP, p-aminobenzoate is made from
  chorismate in plastids, and the two are coupled together in mitochondria to give
  dihydropteroate.  Glutamylation and reduction steps in mitochondria then yield THF
  (Hanson and Gregory, 2011; Ravanel et al., 2011).  THF and its one-carbon derivatives
  (collectively termed folates) occur mainly as polyglutamates; these have a short
  polyglutamyl tail that can be added in mitochondria, plastids, or cytosol.  Folate
  polyglutamates can be imported into vacuoles, where the polyglutamyl tail can be
  removed by γ-glutamylhydrolase. p-Aminobenzoate can be converted to its glucose
  ester in the cytosol, and imported into vacuoles.
