description: 'This pathway shows how all 45 different subunits are assembled into
  complex 1 (relevant for the electron transport chain, also known as OXPHOS system),
  which chaperones(visualised with a small circle and a "C'') and which post-translational
  modifications (a dimethylation on NDUFS2 and hydroxylation on NDUFS7, both in the
  Q-module) are needed for this assembly. Most of the steps involved in this intricate
  process have been described in separate literature references, which have been combined
  in a review by Alba Signes and Erika Fernandez-Vizarra[https://doi.org/10.1042/EBC20170098].
  If possible (based on the size of the protein in KD and available protein structures
  in Uniprot), the colour of the protein structure drawings have been matched to the
  annotated protein DataNodes. Abbreviations: IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane
  space.'
