    "description": "A schematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 signaling pathway. The pathway map represents protein-protein interactions and the downstream molecular events regulated by SARS-CoV-2 including molecular association, catalysis, and gene regulation events. Each events are color coded as described in the pathway legend. Information pertaining to site and residue of post-translational modification are also included in the pathway map.",
