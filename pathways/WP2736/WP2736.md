description: 'The generation of insulin-containing secretory granules from proinsulin
  in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can be described in 4 steps: formation
  of intramolecular disulfide bonds, formation of proinsulin-zinc-calcium complexes,
  proteolytic cleavage of proinsulin to yield insulin, translocation of the granules
  across the cytosol to the plasma membrane.<br>Transcription of the human insulin
  gene INS is activated by 4 important transcription factors: Pdx-1, MafA, Beta2/NeuroD1,
  and E47. The transcription factors interact with each other at the promoters of
  the insulin gene and act synergistically to promote transcription. Expression of
  the transcription factors is upregulated in response to glucose.<br>The preproinsulin
  mRNA is translated by ribosomes at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the
  preproinsulin enters the secretion pathway by virtue of its signal peptide, which
  is cleaved during translation to yield proinsulin. Evidence indicates that the preproinsulin
  mRNA is stabilized by glucose.<br>In the process annotated in detail here, within
  the ER, three intramolecular disulfide bonds form between cysteine residues in the
  proinsulin. Formation of the bonds is the spontaneous result of the conformation
  of proinsulin and the oxidizing environment of the ER, which is maintained by Ero1-like
  alpha<br>The cystine bonded proinsulin then moves via vesicles from the ER to the
  Golgi Complex. High concentrations of zinc are maintained in the Golgi by zinc transporters
  ZnT5, ZnT6, and ZnT7 and the proinsulin forms complexes with zinc and calcium.<br>Proinsulin-zinc-calcium
  complexes bud in vesicles from the trans-Golgi to form immature secretory vesicles
  (secretory granules) in the cytosol. Within the immature granules the endoproteases
  Prohormone Convertase 1/3 and Prohormone Convertase 2 cleave at two sites of the
  proinsulin and Carboxypeptidase E removes a further 4 amino acid residues to yield
  the cystine-bonded A and B chains of mature insulin and the C peptide, which will
  also be secreted with the insulin. The insulin-zinc-calcium complexes form insoluble
  crystals within the granule<br>The insulin-containing secretory granules are then
  translocated across the cytosol to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Translocation
  occurs initially by attachment of the granules to Kinesin-1, which motors along
  microtubules, and then by attachment to Myosin Va, which motors along the microfilaments
  of the cortical actin network.<br>A pancreatic beta cell contains about 10000 insulin
  granules of which about 1000 are docked at the plasma membrane and 50 are readily
  releasable in immediate response to stimulation by glucose or other secretogogues.
  Docking is due to interaction between the Exocyst proteins EXOC3 on the granule
  membrane and EXOC4 on the plasma membrane. Exocytosis is accomplished by interaction
  between SNARE-type proteins Syntaxin 1A and Syntaxin 4 on the plasma membrane and
  Synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 on the granule membrane. Exocytosis is a calcium-dependent
  process due to interaction of the calcium-binding membrane protein Synaptotagmin
  V/IX with the SNARE-type proteins.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=264876
