Activation of NMDA
receptors and
postsynaptic events	Pathway	R-HSA-442755	Reactome	NMDA receptors are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are specifically activated by a glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Activation of NMDA receptors involves opening of the ion channel that allows the influx of Ca2+. NMDA receptors are central to activity dependent changes in synaptic strength and are predominantly involved in the synaptic plasticity that pertains to learning and memory. A unique feature of NMDA receptors, unlike other glutamate receptors, is the requirement for dual activation, both voltage-dependent and ligand-dependent activation. The ligand-dependent activation of NMDA receptors requires co-activation by two ligands, glutamate and glycine. However, at resting membrane potential, the pore of ligand-bound NMDA receptors is blocked by Mg2+. The voltage dependent Mg2+ block is relieved upon depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane. NMDA receptors are coincidence detectors, and are activated only if there is a simultaneous activation of both pre- and post-synaptic cell. Upon activation, NMDA receptors allow the influx of Ca2+ that initiates various molecular signaling cascades involved in the processes of learning and memory. For review, please refer to Cohen and Greenberg 2008, Hardingham and Bading 2010, Traynelis et al. 2010, and Paoletti et al. 2013.

YAP1- and WWTR1
(TAZ)-stimulated
gene expression	Pathway	R-HSA-2032785	Reactome	YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) are transcriptional co-activators, both homologues of the Drosophila Yorkie protein. They both interact with members of the TEAD family of transcription factors, and WWTR1 interacts as well with TBX5 and RUNX2, to promote gene expression. Their transcriptional targets include genes critical to regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Their subcellular location is regulated by the Hippo signaling cascade: phosphorylation mediated by this cascade leads to the cytosolic sequestration of both proteins (Murakami et al. 2005; Oh and Irvine 2010).

RAF/MAP kinase
cascade	Pathway	R-HSA-5673001	Reactome	The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway regulates processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence and cell motility in response to growth factors, hormones and cytokines, among others. Binding of these stimuli to receptors in the plasma membrane promotes the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and initiates the three-tiered kinase cascade of the conventional MAPK cascades.  GTP-bound RAS recruits RAF (the MAPK kinase kinase), and promotes its dimerization and activation (reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014; Roskoski, 2010; McKay and Morrison, 2007; Wellbrock et al, 2004).  Activated RAF phosphorylates the MAPK kinase proteins MEK1 and MEK2 (also known as MAP2K1 and MAP2K2), which in turn phophorylate the proline-directed kinases ERK1 and 2 (also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1) (reviewed in Roskoski, 2012a, b; Kryiakis and Avruch, 2012).  Activated ERK proteins may undergo dimerization and have identified targets in both the nucleus and the cytosol; consistent with this, a proportion of activated ERK protein relocalizes to the nucleus in response to stimuli (reviewed in Roskoski 2012b; Turjanski et al, 2007; Plotnikov et al, 2010; Cargnello et al, 2011).  Although initially seen as a linear cascade originating at the plasma membrane and culminating in the nucleus, the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is now also known to be activated from various intracellular location.  Temporal and spatial specificity of the cascade is achieved in part through the interaction of pathway components with numerous scaffolding proteins (reviewed in McKay and Morrison, 2007; Brown and Sacks, 2009). <br> The importance of the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is highlighted by the fact that components of this pathway are mutated with high frequency in a large number of human cancers.  Activating mutations in RAS are found in approximately one third of human cancers, while ~8% of tumors express an activated form of BRAF (Roberts and Der, 2007; Davies et al, 2002; Cantwell-Dorris et al, 2011).

PIP3 activates AKT
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-1257604	Reactome	Signaling by AKT is one of the key outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. AKT is activated by the cellular second messenger PIP3, a phospholipid that is generated by PI3K. In ustimulated cells, PI3K class IA enzymes reside in the cytosol as inactive heterodimers composed of p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1). Phosphorylation of both the threonine and the serine residue is required to fully activate AKT. The active AKT then dissociates from PIP3 and phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins that play important roles in cell survival and metabolism. For a recent review of AKT signaling, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007.

Signaling by Hippo	Pathway	R-HSA-2028269	Reactome	Human Hippo signaling is a network of reactions that regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis, centered on a three-step kinase cascade. The cascade was discovered by analysis of Drosophila mutations that lead to tissue overgrowth, and human homologues of its components have since been identified and characterized at a molecular level. Data from studies of mice carrying knockout mutant alleles of the genes as well as from studies of somatic mutations in these genes in human tumors are consistent with the conclusion that in mammals, as in flies, the Hippo cascade is required for normal regulation of cell proliferation and defects in the pathway are associated with cell overgrowth and tumorigenesis (Oh and Irvine 2010; Pan 2010; Zhao et al. 2010). This group of reactions is also notable for its abundance of protein:protein interactions mediated by WW domains and PPxY sequence motifs (Sudol and Harvey 2010).<p>There are two human homologues of each of the three Drosophila kinases, whose functions are well conserved: expression of human proteins rescues fly mutants. The two members of each pair of human homologues have biochemically indistinguishable functions. Autophosphorylated STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1) (homologues of Drosophila Hippo) catalyze the phosphorylation and activation of LATS1 and LATS2 (homologues of Drosophila Warts) and of the accessory proteins MOB1A and MOB1B (homologues of Drosophila Mats). LATS1 and LATS2 in turn catalyze the phosphorylation of the transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) (homologues of Drosophila Yorkie).<p>In their unphosphorylated states, YAP1 and WWTR1 freely enter the nucleus and function as transcriptional co-activators. In their phosphorylated states, however, YAP1 and WWTR1 are instead bound by 14-3-3 proteins, YWHAB and YWHAE respectively, and sequestered in the cytosol.<p>Several accessory proteins are required for the three-step kinase cascade to function. STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1) each form a complex with SAV1 (homologue of Drosophila Salvador), and LATS1 and LATS2 form complexes with MOB1A and MOB1B (homologues of Drosophila Mats).<p>In Drosophila a complex of three proteins, Kibra, Expanded, and Merlin, can trigger the Hippo cascade. A human homologue of Kibra, WWC1, has been identified and indirect evidence suggests that it can regulate the human Hippo pathway (Xiao et al. 2011). A molecular mechanism for this interaction has not yet been worked out and the molecular steps that trigger the Hippo kinase cascade in humans are unknown.<p>Four additional processes related to human Hippo signaling, although incompletely characterized, have been described in sufficient detail to allow their annotation. All are of physiological interest as they are likely to be parts of mechanisms by which Hippo signaling is modulated or functionally linked to other signaling processes. First, the caspase 3 protease cleaves STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1), releasing inhibitory carboxyterminal domains in each case, leading to increased kinase activity and YAP1 / TAZ phosphorylation (Lee et al. 2001). Second, cytosolic AMOT (angiomotin) proteins can bind YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) in their unphosphorylated states, a process that may provide a Hippo-independent mechanism to down-regulate the activities of these proteins (Chan et al. 2011). Third, WWTR1 (TAZ) and YAP1 bind ZO-1 and 2 proteins (Remue et al. 2010; Oka et al. 2010). Fourth, phosphorylated WWTR1 (TAZ) binds and sequesters DVL2, providing a molecular link between Hippo and Wnt signaling (Varelas et al. 2010).

Prolactin receptor
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-1170546	Reactome	Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone secreted mainly by the anterior pituitary gland. It was originally identified by its ability to stimulate the development of the mammary gland and lactation, but is now known to have numerous and varied functions (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998). Despite this, few pathologies have been associated with abnormalities in prolactin receptor (PRLR) signaling, though roles in various forms of cancer and certain autoimmune disorders have been suggested (Goffin et al. 2002). A vast body of literature suggests effects of PRL in immune cells (Matera 1996) but PRLR KO mice have unaltered immune system development and function (Bouchard et al. 1999). In addition to the pituitary, numerous other tissues produce PRL, including the decidua and myometrium, certain cells of the immune system, brain, skin and exocrine glands such as the mammary, sweat and lacrimal glands (Ben-Jonathan et al. 1996). Pituitary PRL secretion is negatively regulated by inhibitory factors originating from the hypothalamus, the most important of which is dopamine, acting through the D2 subclass of dopamine receptors present in lactotrophs (Freeman et al. 2000). PRL-binding sites or receptors have been identified in numerous cells and tissues of adult mammals. Various forms of PRLR, generated by alternative splicing, have been reported in several species including humans (Kelly et al. 1991, Clevenger et al. 2003).<br><br>PRLR is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Like many other members of this family, the first step in receptor activation was generally believed to be ligand-induced dimerization whereby one molecule of PRL bound to two molecules of receptor (Elkins et al. 2000). Recent reports suggest that PRLR pre-assembles at the plasma membrane in the absence of ligand (Gadd & Clevenger 2006, Tallet et al. 2011), suggesting that ligand-induced activation involves conformational changes in preformed PRLR dimers (Broutin et al. 2010). <br><br>PRLR has no intrinsic kinase activity but associates (Lebrun et al. 1994, 1995) with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) which is activated following receptor activation (Campbell et al. 1994, Rui et al. 1994, Carter-Su et al. 2000, Barua et al. 2009). JAK2-dependent activation of JAK1 has also been reported (Neilson et al. 2007). It is generally accepted that activation of JAK2 occurs by transphosphorylation upon ligand-induced receptor activation, based on JAK activation by chimeric receptors in which various extracellular domains of cytokine or tyrosine kinase receptors were fused to the IL-2 receptor beta chain (see Ihle et al. 1994). This activation step involves the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, which in turn phosphorylates PRLR on specific intracellular tyrosine residues leading to STAT5 recruitment and signaling, considered to be the most important signaling cascade for PRLR. STAT1 and STAT3 activation have also been reported (DaSilva et al. 1996) as have many other signaling pathways; signaling through MAP kinases (Shc/SOS/Grb2/Ras/Raf/MAPK) has been reported as a consequence of PRL stimuilation in many different cellular systems (see Bole-Feysot et al. 1998) though it is not clear how this signal is propagated. Other cascades non exhaustively include Src kinases, Focal adhesion kinase, phospholipase C gamma, PI3 kinase/Akt and Nek3 (Clevenger et al. 2003, Miller et al. 2007). The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is recruited to the C terminal tyrosine of PRLR and may have a regulatory role (Ali & Ali 2000). PRLR phosphotyrosines can recruit insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and other adaptor proteins to the receptor complex (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998).<br><br>Female homozygous PRLR knockout mice are completely infertile and show a lack of mammary development (Ormandy et al. 1997). Hemizogotes are unable to lactate following their first pregnancy and depending on the genetic background, this phenotype can persist through subsequent pregnancies (Kelly et al. 2001).
