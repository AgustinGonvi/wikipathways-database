description: The N-terminal fragment of ATF6-alpha contains a bZIP domain and binds
  the sequence CCACG in ER Stress Response Elements (ERSEs). ATF6-alpha binds ERSEs
  together with the heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y, which binds the sequence
  CCAAT in the ERSEs, and together the two factors activate transcription of ER stress-responsive
  genes. Evidence from overexpression and knockdowns indicates that ATF6-alpha is
  a potent activator but its homolog ATF6-beta is not and ATF6-beta may actually reduce
  expression of ER stress proteins.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=381183
