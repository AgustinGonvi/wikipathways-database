description: The N-terminal fragment of ATF6-alpha contains a bZIP domain and binds the sequence CCACG in ER Stress Response Elements (ERSEs). ATF6-alpha binds ERSEs together with the heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y, which binds the sequence CCAAT in the ERSEs, and together the two factors activate transcription of ER stress-responsive genes. Evidence from overexpression and knockdowns indicates that ATF6-alpha is a potent activator but its homolog ATF6-beta is not and ATF6-beta may actually reduce expression of ER stress proteins.
