description: 'YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) are transcriptional co-activators, both homologues
  of the Drosophila Yorkie protein. They both interact with members of the TEAD family
  of transcription factors, and WWTR1 interacts as well with TBX5 and RUNX2, to promote
  gene expression. Their transcriptional targets include genes critical to regulation
  of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Their subcellular location is regulated by
  the Hippo signaling cascade: phosphorylation mediated by this cascade leads to the
  cytosolic sequestration of both proteins (Murakami et al. 2005; Oh and Irvine 2010).  View
