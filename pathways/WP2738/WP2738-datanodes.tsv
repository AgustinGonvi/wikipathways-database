Signaling by Hippo	Pathway	R-HSA-2028269	Reactome	Human Hippo signaling is a network of reactions that regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis, centered on a three-step kinase cascade. The cascade was discovered by analysis of Drosophila mutations that lead to tissue overgrowth, and human homologues of its components have since been identified and characterized at a molecular level. Data from studies of mice carrying knockout mutant alleles of the genes as well as from studies of somatic mutations in these genes in human tumors are consistent with the conclusion that in mammals, as in flies, the Hippo cascade is required for normal regulation of cell proliferation and defects in the pathway are associated with cell overgrowth and tumorigenesis (Oh and Irvine 2010; Pan 2010; Zhao et al. 2010). This group of reactions is also notable for its abundance of protein:protein interactions mediated by WW domains and PPxY sequence motifs (Sudol and Harvey 2010).<p>There are two human homologues of each of the three Drosophila kinases, whose functions are well conserved: expression of human proteins rescues fly mutants. The two members of each pair of human homologues have biochemically indistinguishable functions. Autophosphorylated STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1) (homologues of Drosophila Hippo) catalyze the phosphorylation and activation of LATS1 and LATS2 (homologues of Drosophila Warts) and of the accessory proteins MOB1A and MOB1B (homologues of Drosophila Mats). LATS1 and LATS2 in turn catalyze the phosphorylation of the transcriptional co-activators YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) (homologues of Drosophila Yorkie).<p>In their unphosphorylated states, YAP1 and WWTR1 freely enter the nucleus and function as transcriptional co-activators. In their phosphorylated states, however, YAP1 and WWTR1 are instead bound by 14-3-3 proteins, YWHAB and YWHAE respectively, and sequestered in the cytosol.<p>Several accessory proteins are required for the three-step kinase cascade to function. STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1) each form a complex with SAV1 (homologue of Drosophila Salvador), and LATS1 and LATS2 form complexes with MOB1A and MOB1B (homologues of Drosophila Mats).<p>In Drosophila a complex of three proteins, Kibra, Expanded, and Merlin, can trigger the Hippo cascade. A human homologue of Kibra, WWC1, has been identified and indirect evidence suggests that it can regulate the human Hippo pathway (Xiao et al. 2011). A molecular mechanism for this interaction has not yet been worked out and the molecular steps that trigger the Hippo kinase cascade in humans are unknown.<p>Four additional processes related to human Hippo signaling, although incompletely characterized, have been described in sufficient detail to allow their annotation. All are of physiological interest as they are likely to be parts of mechanisms by which Hippo signaling is modulated or functionally linked to other signaling processes. First, the caspase 3 protease cleaves STK3 (MST2) and STK4 (MST1), releasing inhibitory carboxyterminal domains in each case, leading to increased kinase activity and YAP1 / TAZ phosphorylation (Lee et al. 2001). Second, cytosolic AMOT (angiomotin) proteins can bind YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) in their unphosphorylated states, a process that may provide a Hippo-independent mechanism to down-regulate the activities of these proteins (Chan et al. 2011). Third, WWTR1 (TAZ) and YAP1 bind ZO-1 and 2 proteins (Remue et al. 2010; Oka et al. 2010). Fourth, phosphorylated WWTR1 (TAZ) binds and sequesters DVL2, providing a molecular link between Hippo and Wnt signaling (Varelas et al. 2010).

Transcriptional
regulation by RUNX2	Pathway	R-HSA-8878166	Reactome	RUNX2 (CBFA1 or AML3) transcription factor, similar to other RUNX family members, RUNX1 and RUNX3, can function in complex with CBFB (CBF-beta) (Kundu et al. 2002, Yoshida et al. 2002, Otto et al. 2002). RUNX2 mainly regulates transcription of genes involved in skeletal development (reviewed in Karsenty 2008). RUNX2 is involved in development of both intramembraneous and endochondral bones through regulation of osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, respectively. RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the BGLAP gene (Ducy and Karsenty 1995, Ducy et al. 1997), which encodes Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone which is one of the most abundant non-collagenous proteins of the bone extracellular matrix (reviewed in Karsenty and Olson 2016). RUNX2 directly controls the expression of most genes associated with osteoblast differentiation and function (Sato et al. 1998, Ducy et al. 1999, Roce et al. 2005). RUNX2-mediated transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in GPCR (G protein coupled receptor) signaling is implicated in the control of growth of osteoblast progenitors (Teplyuk et al. 2009). RUNX2 promotes chondrocyte maturation by stimulating transcription of the IHH gene, encoding Indian hedgehog (Takeda et al. 2001, Yoshida et al. 2004). Germline loss-of-function mutations of the RUNX2 gene are associated with cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome (CCD), an autosomal skeletal disorder (reviewed in Jaruga et al. 2016). The function of RUNX2 is frequently disrupted in osteosarcoma (reviewed in Mortus et al. 2014). Vitamin D3 is implicated in regulation of transcriptional activity of the RUNX2:CBFB complex (Underwood et al. 2012).<p>RUNX2 expression is regulated by estrogen signaling, and RUNX2 is implicated in breast cancer development and metastasis (reviewed in Wysokinski et al. 2014). Besides estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRA) (Kammerer et al. 2013), RUNX2 transcription is also regulated by TWIST1 (Yang, Yang et al. 2011), glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) (Zhang et al. 2012), NKX3-2 (BAPX1) (Tribioli and Lufkin 1999, Lengner et al. 2005), DLX5 (Robledo et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2005) and MSX2 (Lee et al. 2005). RUNX2 can autoregulate, by directly inhibiting its own transcription (Drissi et al. 2000). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases target RUNX2 for proteasome-mediated degradation: FBXW7a (Kumar et al. 2015), STUB1 (CHIP) (Li et al. 2008), SMURF1 (Zhao et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2014), WWP1 (Jones et al. 2006), and SKP2 (Thacker et al. 2016). Besides formation of RUNX2:CBFB heterodimers, transcriptional activity of RUNX2 is regulated by binding to a number of other transcription factors, for example SOX9 (Zhou et al. 2006, TWIST1 (Bialek et al. 2004) and RB1 (Thomas et al. 2001).<p>RUNX2 regulates expression of several genes implicated in cell migration during normal development and bone metastasis of breast cancer cells. RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the ITGA5 gene, encoding Integrin alpha 5 (Li et al. 2016) and the ITGBL1 gene, encoding Integrin beta like protein 1 (Li et al. 2015). RUNX2 mediated transcription of the MMP13 gene, encoding Colagenase 3 (Matrix metalloproteinase 13), is stimulated by AKT mediated phosphorylation of RUNX2 (Pande et al. 2013). RUNX2 is implicated in positive regulation of AKT signaling by stimulating expression of AKT-activating TORC2 complex components MTOR and RICTOR, which may contribute to survival of breast cancer cells (Tandon et al. 2014).<p>RUNX2 inhibits CDKN1A transcription, thus preventing CDKN1A-induced cell cycle arrest. Phosphorylation of RUNX2 by CDK4 in response to high glucose enhances RUNX2-mediated repression of the CDKN1A gene in endothelial cells (Pierce et al. 2012). In mice, Runx2-mediated repression of Cdkn1a may contribute to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Kuo et al. 2009). RUNX2 can stimulate transcription of the LGALS3 gene, encoding Galectin-3 (Vladimirova et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009). Galectin 3 is expressed in myeloid progenitors and its levels increase during the maturation process (Le Marer 2000).<p>For a review of RUNX2 function, please refer to Long 2012 and Ito et al. 2015.
