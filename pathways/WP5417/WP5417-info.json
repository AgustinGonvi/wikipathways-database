    "description": "This cell lineage map consists of a set of cell types emerging during neural differentiation.  A selection of cell type-specific markers was made based on literature  (e.g. Beccari et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0578-0;  KÃ¼gler et al., 2010, https://doi.org/10.14573/altex.2010.1.16;  Spangler et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scr.2018.07.022;  Tao and Zhang, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2016.10.015)  to distinguish these different cell types.  This map was published in: Victoria de Leeuw et al., 2020, NeuroToxicology 76, 1-9. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2019.09.014. ",
