    "description": "This pathway shows the variable role of metabolic kinases, PGK1, PKM1 and KHKC/KHKA, acting as protein kinases. They are able to phosphorylate and thereby activate second messenger enzymes, which greatly influence cellular functions. This Pathway is based on Figure 1 of the paper \"Metabolic Kinases Moonlighting as Protein Kinases\" PMID: 29463470.",
