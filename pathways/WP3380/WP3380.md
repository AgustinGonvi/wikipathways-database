description: The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is
  expressed in immune and nonimmune cell types including macrophages, T cells, mast
  cells, granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, fibroblasts, neurons, keratinocytes
  and smooth muscle cells as a response to tissue injury or upon immune responses
  to pathogenic stimuli (KÃ¶ck A. et al. 1990; Dubravec DB et al. 1990; Walsh LJ et
  al. 1991; te Velde AA et al. 1990; Imaizumi T et al. 2000). TNF-alpha interacts
  with two receptors, namely TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Activation
  of TNFR1 can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways inducing inflammation,
  proliferation, survival or cell death (Ward C et al. 1999; Micheau O and Tschopp
  J 2003; Widera D et al. 2006). Whether a TNF-alpha-stimulated cell will survive
  or die is dependent on autocrine/paracrine signals, and on the cellular context.<p>TNF
  binding to TNFR1 results initially in the formation of complex I that consists of
  TNFR1, TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain), TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor-2),
  RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serin/threonine protein kinase 1), and E3 ubiquitin
  ligases BIRC2,BIRC3 (cIAP1/2,cellular inhibitor of apoptosis) and LUBAC (Micheau
  O and Tschopp J 2003). The conjugation of ubiquitin chains by BIRC2/3 and LUBAC
  (composed of HOIP, HOIL-1 and SHARPIN ) to RIPK1 allows further recruitment and
  activation of the TAK1 (also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase
  7 (MAP3K7)) complex and IÎºB kinase (IKK) complex. TAK1 and IKK phosphorylate RIPK1
  to limit its cytotoxic activity  and activate both nuclear factor kappaâ€�lightâ€�chainâ€�enhancer
  of activated B cells (NFkappaB) and mitogenâ€�activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling
  pathways promoting cell survival by induction of anti-apoptotic proteins such as
  BIRC, cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1Î²-converting enzyme)-like inhibitory protein
  (cFLIP) and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-6). When the survival
  pathway is inhibited, the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1 detaches from the membrane-bound TNFR1
  signaling complex and recruits Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD)
  and procaspase-8 (also known as complex II). Once recruited to FADD, multiple procaspase-8
  molecules interact via their tandem death-effector domains( DED), thereby facilitating
  both proximity-induced dimerization and proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8, which
  are required for initiation of apoptotic cell death (Hughes MA et al. 2009; Oberst
  A et al. 2010). When caspase activity is inhibited under certain pathophysiological
  conditions (e.g. caspase-8 inhibitory proteins such as CrmA and vICA after infection
  with cowpox virus or CMV) or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated RIPK1 is
  physically and functionally engaged by its homolog RIPK3 leading to formation of
  the necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Tewari
  M & Dixit VM 1995; Fliss PM & Brune W 2012; Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013;
  Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al., 2009).
  Within the complex II procaspase-8 can also form heterodimers with cFLIP isoforms,
  FLIP long (L) and FLIP short (S), which are encoded by the NFkappaB target gene
  CFLAR (Irmler M et al. 1997; Boatright KM et al. 2004; Yu JW et al. 2009; Pop C
  et al. 2011). FLIP(S) appears to act purely as an antagonist of caspase-8 activity
  blocking apoptotic but promoting necroptotic cell death (Feoktistova  et al. 2011).
  The regulatory function of FLIP(L) has been found to differ depending on its expression
  levels. FLIP(L) was shown to inhibit death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis only
  when expressed at high levels, while low cell levels of FLIP(L) enhanced DR signaling
  to apoptosis (Boatright KM et al. 2004; Okano H et al. 2003; Yerbes R et al. 2011;
  Yu JW et al. 2009; Hughes MA et al. 2016). In addition, caspase-8:FLIP(L) heterodimer
  activity within the TRADD:TRAF2:RIPK1:FADD:CASP8:FLIP(L) complex allowed cleavage
  of RIPK1 to cause the dissociation of the TRADD:TRAF2:RIP1:FADD:CASP8, thereby inhibiting
  RIPK1-mediated necroptosis (Feoktistova  et al. 2011, 2012). TNF-alpha can also
  activate sphingomyelinase (SMASE, such as SMPD2,3) proteins to catalyze hydrolysis
  of sphingomyeline into ceramide (Adam D et al.1996; Adam-Klages S et al. 1998; SÃ©gui
  B et al. 2001). Activation of neutral SMPD2,3 leads to an accumulation of ceramide
  at the cell surface and has proinflammatory effects. However, TNF can also activate
  the pro-apoptotic acidic SMASE via caspase-8 mediated activation of caspase-7 which
  in turn proteolytically cleaves and activates the 72kDa pro-A-SMase form (Edelmann
  B et al. 2011). Ceramide induces anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses.
  Further, ceramide can be converted by ceramidase into sphingosine, which in turn
  is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P
  exerts the opposite biological effects to ceramide by activating cytoprotective
  signaling to promote cell growth counteracting the apoptotic stimuli (Cuvillier
  O et al. 1996). Thus, TNF-alpha-induced TNFR1 activation leads to divergent intracellular
  signaling networks with extensive cross-talk between the pro-apoptotic/necroptotic
  pathway, and the other NFkappaB, and MAPK pathways providing highly specific cell
  responses initiated by various types of stimuli.   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=75893
