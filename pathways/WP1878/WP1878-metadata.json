  "description": "In humans, the catabolism of phytanate, pristanate, and very long chain fatty acids as well as the first four steps of the biosynthesis of plasmalogens are catalyzed by peroxisomal enzymes. Defects in any of these enzymes or in the assembly of peroxisomes are associated with severe developmental disorders (Wanders and Watherham 2006).
