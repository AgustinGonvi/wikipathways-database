description: Growth hormone (Somatotropin or GH) is a key factor in determining lean
  body mass, stimulating the growth and metabolism of muscle, bone and cartilage cells,
  while reducing body fat. It has many other roles; it acts to regulate cell growth,
  differentiation, apoptosis, and reorganisation of the cytoskeleton, affecting diverse
  processes such as cardiac function, immune function, brain function, and aging.  GH
  also has insulin-like effects such as stimulating amino acid transport, protein
  synthesis, glucose transport, and lipogenesis. The growth hormone receptor (GHR)
  is a a member of the cytokine receptor family. When the dimeric receptor binds GH
  it undergoes a conformational change which leads to phosphorylation of key tyrosine
  residues in its cytoplasmic domains and activation of associated tyrosine kinase
  JAK2. This leads to recruitment of signaling molecules such as STAT5 and Src family
  kinases such as Lyn leading to ERK activation. The signal is attenuated by association
  of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) proteins and SHP phosphatases which bind
  to or dephosphorylate specific phosphorylated tyrosines on GHR/JAK. The availability
  of GHR on the cell surface is regulated by at least two processes; internalization
  and cleavage from the suface by metalloproteases.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=982772
