description: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are tetramers that consist of
  two GluN1 (GRIN1) subunits and two subunits that belong to either the GluN2 (GRIN2)
  subfamily (GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C and GluN2D) or the GluN3 (GRIN3) subfamily (GluN3A
  and GluN3B). The GluN2/GluN3 subunits in the NMDA tetramer can either be identical,
  constituting an NMDA di-heteromer (di-heterotetramer), which consists of two subunit
  types, GluN1 and one of GluN2s/GluN3s, or they can be two different GluN2/GluN3
  proteins, constituting an NMDA tri-heteromer (tri-heterotetramer), which consists
  of three subunit types, GluN1 and two of GluN2s/GluN3s (Monyer et al. 1992, Wafford
  et al. 1993, Sheng et al. 1994, Dunah et al. 1998, Perez-Otano et al. 2001, Chatterton
  et al. 2002, Matsuda et al. 2002, Yamakura et al. 2005, Nilsson et al. 2007, Hansen
  et al. 2014, Kaiser et al. 2018, Bhattacharya et al. 2018, Bhattacharya and Traynelis
  2018).<br>NMDA tetramers assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum and traffic to the
  plasma membrane as part of transport vesicles (McIlhinney et al. 1998, Perez-Otano
  et al. 2001). NMDA receptor subunits undergo N-glycosylation, which impacts their
  trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Trafficking efficiency
  may vary among different subunits of NMDARs (Lichnereva et al. 2015). Mechanistic
  details, such as glycosyl transferases involved and the type of sugar side chains
  added, are not known.<br>As there are eight splicing isoforms of GluN1, four different
  GluN2 and two different GluN3 proteins, many different combinations of NMDAR subunits
  are possible, but only a handful of distinct NMDAR receptors have been experimentally
  confirmed and functionally studied. The composition of NMDARs affects trafficking,
  spatial (including synaptic) localization, ligand preference, channel conductivity
  and downstream signal transmission. Prevalent NMDARs differ at different stages
  of neuronal development, in different regions of the central nervous system, and
  at different levels of neuronal activity. For review, please refer to Lau and Zukin
