description: This pathway depicts the regulation of GABA receptor surface expression
  of BDNF signaling.  BDNF can be secreted in both a mature form (mBDNF) and a precursor
  form (proBDNF), both of which modulate GABA synaptic transmission in neurons.   mBDNF
  activates TrkB receptors leading to an inhibition of GABAAR endocytosis and a consequent
  increase in cell surface expression of these receptors through the PI 3-kinase and
  the PKC signaling pathway. In addition, BDNF/TrkB signaling regulates GABAAR and
  KCC2 at the transcriptional level through the Shc, PLCg and MAP/ERK pathways.  proBDNF
  activates NGFR, which decreases GABAARs cell surface expression through the RhoA/ROCK/PTEN
  pathway, through dephosphorylation of GABAAR followed by endocytosis and degradation
  of internalized receptors. proBNDF/NGFR signaling also leads to the transcriptional
  repression of GABAAR synthesis through JAK2/STAT3/CREM. The proBDNF/NGFR signaling
  also decreases KCC2 expression.   This pathway is based on figure 1 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121065/
  Porcher et al].
