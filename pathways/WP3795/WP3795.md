description: Striated muscle contraction is a process whereby force is generated within
  striated muscle tissue, resulting in a change in muscle geometry, or in short, increased
  force being exerted on the tendons. Force generation involves a chemo-mechanical
  energy conversion step that is carried out by the actin/myosin complex activity,
  which generates force through ATP hydrolysis. Striated muscle is a type of muscle
  composed of myofibrils, containing repeating units called sarcomeres, in which the
  contractile myofibrils are arranged in parallel to the axis of the cell, resulting
  in transverse or oblique striations observable at the level of the light microscope.<br>Here
  striated muscle contraction is represented on the basis of calcium binding to the
  troponin complex, which exposes the active sites of actin. Once the active sites
  of actin are exposed, the myosin complex bound to ADP can bind actin and the myosin
  head can pivot, pulling the thin actin and thick myosin filaments past one another.
  Once the myosin head pivots, ADP is ejected, a fresh ATP can be bound and the energy
  from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is channeled into kinetic energy by resetting
  the myosin head. With repeated rounds of this cycle the sarcomere containing the
  thin and thick filaments effectively shortens, forming the basis of muscle contraction.  View
