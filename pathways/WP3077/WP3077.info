description: This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has been demonstrated in another species. The inference is based on Ensembl Compara orthology projection. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities (in input, output and catalyst) have a mapped ortholog or paralog are inferred to the other species. High-level events are also inferred for these events to allow for easier navigation.  Source: [http://plantreactome.gramene.org/ Plant Reactome].
