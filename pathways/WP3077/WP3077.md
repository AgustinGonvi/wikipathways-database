description: 'This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has
  been demonstrated in another species. The inference is based on Ensembl Compara
  orthology projection. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities
  (in input, output and catalyst) have a mapped ortholog or paralog are inferred to
  the other species. High-level events are also inferred for these events to allow
  for easier navigation.  Source: [http://plantreactome.gramene.org/ Plant Reactome].'
