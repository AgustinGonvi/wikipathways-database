description: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are
  conserved and specific molecular "signatures" expressed by pathogens. TLR ligation
  triggers distinct but shared signaling pathways that lead to effector mechanisms
  in innate immune responses. TLR specificity and activation are strictly and finely
  tuned at multiple levels of various signal transduction pathways, resulting in complex
  signaling platforms. Many molecules, ranging from membrane and cytosol to nuclear,
  contribute to TLR ligand discrimination or receptor signaling and play different
  roles in the regulation of TLR responses via different mechanisms, such as cross-regulation,
  protein modification, helper cofactors, and posttranscriptional and epigenetic regulation.
