description: '19 WNT proteins have been identified in human cells.  The WNTs are members
  of a conserved metazoan family of secreted morphogens that activate several signaling
  pathways in the responding cell: the canonical (beta-catenin) WNT signaling cascade
  and several non-canonical pathways, including the planar cell polarity (PCP), the
  regulation of intracellular calcium signaling and  activation of JNK kinases.  WNT
  proteins exist in a gradient outside the secreting cell and are able to act over
  both short and long ranges to promote proliferation, changes in cell migration and
  polarity and tissue homeostasis, among others (reviewed in Saito-Diaz et al, 2012;
  Willert and Nusse, 2012).  <br><br><br>The WNTs are ~40kDa proteins with 23 conserved
  cysteine residues in the N-terminal that may form intramolecular disulphide bonds.
  They also contain an N-terminal signal sequence and a number of N-linked glycosylation
  sites (Janda et al, 2012). In addition to being glycosylated, WNTs are also lipid-modified
  in the endoplasmic reticulum by a WNT-specific O-acyl-transferase, Porcupine (PORCN),
  contributing to their characteristic hydrophobicity.  PORCN-dependent palmitoylation
  is required for the secretion of WNT as well as its signaling activity, as either
  depletion of PORCN or mutation of the conserved serine acylation site results in
  the intracellular accumulation of WNT ligand (Takada et al, 2006; Barrott et al,
  2011; Biechele et al, 2011; reviewed in Willert and Nusse, 2012).<br><br><br>Secretion
  of WNT requires a number of other dedicated factors including the sorting receptor
  Wntless (WLS) (also knownas Evi, Sprinter, and GPR177), which binds WNT and escorts
  it to the cell surface (Banziger et al, 2006; Bartscherer et al, 2006; Goodman et
  al, 2006).  A WNT-specific retromer containing SNX3 is subsequently required for
  the recycling of WLS back to the Golgi (reviewed in Herr et al, 2012; Johannes and
  Wunder,  2011).   Once at the cell surface, WNT makes extensive contacts with components
  of the extracellular matrix such as heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and may
  be bound by any of a number of regulatory proteins, including WIFs and SFRPs. The
  diffusion of the WNT ligand may be aided by its packing either into WNT multimers,
  exosomes or onto lipoprotein particles to shield the hydrophobic lipid adducts from
  the aqueous extracellular environment (Gross et al, 2012; Luga et al, 2012, Korkut
  et al, 2009; reviewed in Willert and Nusse, 2012).<br><br >  View original pathway
