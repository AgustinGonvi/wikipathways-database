description: Pentose phosphate, phosphogluconate, or hexose monophsphate pathway oxidizes
  glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-P. NADP+ is the
  electron acceptor. The pathways yields NADPH as well as 5, 4, and 7 carbon intermediaries
  for synthesis of nucleotides.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP134 CPTAC Assay Portal]
