Description: This pathway is modeled on a description provided in Zhang et al. under the title "A deficiency in the necrosis pathway confers tolerance to Cry6Aa". Cry6Aa binds to the calcium channel ITR-1 and increases intracellular Ca2+ levels. Ca2+ binds to and activates Calpain TRA-3 which promotes cysteine protease activity. Cysteine Protease activates VHA-12 that uses ATP to increase pH of the cytosol. The increase in H+ concentration signals to the ASP-1/ASP-3/ASP-4 complex which leads to activation of killer cathepsin protease and leads to cell necrosis.
