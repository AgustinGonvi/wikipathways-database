description: 'Peroxisomes are small cellular organelles that are bounded by a single
  membrane and contain variable compositions of proteins depending on cell type. Peroxisomes
  function in oxidation of fatty acids, detoxification of glyoxylate, and synthesis
  of plasmalogens, glycerophospholipids containing an alcohol with a vinyl-ether bond
  (reviewed in Lohdi and Semenkovich 2014). All of the approximately 46 proteins contained
  in peroxisomal matrix are imported from the cytosol by a unique mechanism that does
  not require the imported proteins to be unfolded as they cross the membrane (Walton
  et al. 1995, reviewed in Ma et al. 2011, Fujiki et al. 2014, Baker et al. 2016,
  Dias et al 2016, Emmanoulidis et al. 2016, Erdmann 2016, Francisco et al. 2017).
  The incompletely characterized process appears to involve the transport of the proteins
  through a variably sized pore in the membrane comprising at least PEX5 and PEX14
  (inferred from the yeast homologs in Meinecke et al. 2010, the yeast pore is reviewed
  in Meinecke et al. 2016). Oligomeric proteins are also observed to cross the peroxisomal
  membrane (Otera and Fujiki 2012) but their transport appears to be less efficient
  than monomeric proteins (Freitas et al. 2011, inferred from mouse homologs in Freitas
  et al. 2015, reviewed in Dias et al. 2016).<br>In the cytosol, receptor proteins,
  PEX5 and PEX7, bind to specific sequence motifs in cargo proteins (Dodt et al. 1995,
  Wiemer et al. 1995, Braverman et al. 1997). The long and short isoforms of PEX5
  (PEX5L and PEX5S) bind peroxisome targeting sequence 1 (PTS1, originally identified
  in firefly luciferase by Gould et al. 1989) found on most peroxisomal matrix proteins;
  PEX7 binds PTS2 (originally identified in rat 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase by Swinkels
  et al. 1991) found on 3 imported proteins thus far in humans. The long isoform of
  PEX5, PEX5L, then binds the PEX7:cargo protein complex (Braverman et al. 1998, Otera
  et al. 2000). PEX5S,L bound to a cargo protein or PEX5L bound to PEX7:cargo protein
  then interacts with a complex comprising PEX13, PEX14, PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12 at
  the peroxisomal membrane (Gould et al. 1996, Fransen et al. 1998, inferred from
  rat homologs in Reguenga et al. 2001).<br>The ensuing step in which the cargo protein
  is translocated across the membrane is not completely understood. During translocation,
  PEX5 and PEX7 become inserted into the membrane (Wiemer et al. 1995, Dodt et al.
  1995, Oliveira et al. 2003) and expose a portion of their polypeptide chains to
  the organellar matrix (Rodrigues et al. 2015). One current model envisages PEX5
  as a plunger that inserts into a transmembrane barrel formed by PEX14, PEX13, PEX2,
  PEX10, and PEX12 (the Docking-Translocation Module) (Francisco et al. 2017).<br>After
  delivering cargo to the matrix, PEX5 and PEX7 are recycled back to the cytosol by
  a process requiring mono-ubiquitination of PEX5 and ATP hydrolysis (Imanaka et al.
  1987, Thoms and Erdmann 2006, Carvalho et al. 2007). PEX7 is not ubiquitinated but
  its recycling requires PEX5 mono-ubiquitination. A subcomplex of the Docking-Translocation
  Module comprising the RING-finger proteins PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12 conjugates a single
  ubiquitin to a cysteine residue of PEX5 (Carvalho et al. 2007, reviewed in Platta
  et al. 2016). The mono-ubiquitinated PEX5 and associated PEX7 are then extracted
  by the exportomer complex consisting of PEX1, PEX6, PEX26, and ZFAND6 (inferred
  from rat homologs in Miyata et al. 2012). PEX1 and PEX6 are members of the ATPases
  Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA) family, a group of proteins that
  use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to remodel molecular complexes. PEX1 and PEX6 form
  a hetero-hexameric ring, best described as a trimer of PEX1/PEX6 dimers (inferred
  from yeast in Platta et al. 2005, yeast homologs reviewed in Schwerter et al. 2017).
  Data on the yeast PEX1:PEX6 complex suggest that these ATPases use a substrate-threading
  mechanism to disrupt protein-protein interactions (Gardner et al. 2018). PEX7 is
  also then returned to the cytosol (Rodrigues et al. 2014). Once in the cytosol,
  ubiquitinated PEX5 is enzymatically deubiquitinated by USP9X and may also be non-enzymatically
  deubiquitinated by nucleophilic attack of the thioester bond between ubiquitin and
  the cysteine residue of PEX5 by small metabolites such as glutathione (Grou et al.
  2012).<br>Defects in peroxisomal import cause human diseases: Zellweger syndrome,
  neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia
  punctata types 1 and 5 (BarÃ¸y et al. 2015, reviewed in Nagotu et al. 2012, Braverman
  et al. 2013, Wanders 2014, Fujiki 2016, Waterham et al. 2016).  View original pathway
