description: Proline is catabolized in two steps to yield L-glutamate gamma-semialdehyde, which can react further with glutamate to yield ornithine and alpha-ketoglutarate (annotated as a reaction of amino acid synthesis and interconversion) or with NAD+ to yield glutamate and NADH + H+ (Phang et al. 2001).
