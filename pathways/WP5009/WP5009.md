description: Proline is catabolized in two steps to yield L-glutamate gamma-semialdehyde,
  which can react further with glutamate to yield ornithine and alpha-ketoglutarate
  (annotated as a reaction of amino acid synthesis and interconversion) or with NAD+
  to yield glutamate and NADH + H+ (Phang et al. 2001).  View original pathway at
