description: Carnosine is known to be an antioxidant, a metal chelator, a Ca(2+) and
  enzyme regulator. It also functions as an inhibitor of protein glycosylation and
  protein-protein cross-linking. Carnosine has also been linked to overcoming muscle
  fatigue, and can only be transported into a working muscle cell. This pathway shows
  the main metabolites of carnosine and their relationship  with each other.
