    "description": "This pathway describes Glycolysis reactions in A. thaliana. The metabolic links with Sucrose metabolism, starch metabolism, Calvin Cycle, TCA Cycle (Krebs Cycle) and Chloroplastic Amino Acid Biosynthesis are represented. Protein identifiers for A. thaliana are from UNIPROT. The pathway is inspired from information drawn for Plant Physiology (Taiz  and Zeiger) Third Edition and KEGG Pathways.",
