description: This pathway describes Glycolysis reactions in A. thaliana. The metabolic
  links with Sucrose metabolism, starch metabolism, Calvin Cycle, TCA Cycle (Krebs
  Cycle) and Chloroplastic Amino Acid Biosynthesis are represented. Protein identifiers
  for A. thaliana are from UNIPROT. The pathway is inspired from information drawn
  for Plant Physiology (Taiz  and Zeiger) Third Edition and KEGG Pathways.
