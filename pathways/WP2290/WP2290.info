Description: Downstream genes of RalA signaling pathways, including the Rac-family GTPase-activating protein RLIP (also known as RLIP76 and ralA binding protein 1 (RALBP1)), CDC42(cell division cycle 42), RAC1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1), RAC2, RAC3, the Y-box transcription factor ZO-1-associated nucleic acidbinding protein (ZONAB, also known as cold shock domain protein A (CSDA)), and two subunits of the exocyst complex, SEC5 (also known as exocyst complex component 2 (EXOC2)) and EXO84 (also known as EXOC8), which are involved in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration
