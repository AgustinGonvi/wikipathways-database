Description: Schematic representation depicts the mechanism of miR-127 in accelerating mesendoderm differentiation. miR-127, through the complementary pairing, suppresses the expression of Lefty2, which is referred to as antagonist to the nodal pathway. Thus, miR-127 induces p-Smad2 expression and finally up-regulates expression of mesendoderm markers.
