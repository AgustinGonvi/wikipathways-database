Description: This pathway provides a clear view of the effects of Glucocorticoids on target gene expression when binding to the GR (glucocorticoid receptor). Inhibiting and activiting effects are given as a result of target gene activation. It summarizes the article of Pelaia et al, 2002, which explains the pathway very detailed.
