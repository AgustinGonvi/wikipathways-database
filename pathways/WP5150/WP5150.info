description: Pathway under construction to explain how Spina Bifida occurs during development. Many genes in the pathway are known risk factors for Spina Bifida. The current theory suggests that the shortage of nucleotides in neuroepithelial cells slows the cellular replication leading to a 'retarded' neural fold development.
