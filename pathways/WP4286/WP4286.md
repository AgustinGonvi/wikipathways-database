description: 'This pathway describes the transcriptomic biomarker TGx-DDI genotoxicity
  assay (consisting of 64 genes) developed to readily distinguish DNA damage-inducing
  (DDI) agents from non-DDI agents.   Abstract from the paper "Development and validation
  of a high-throughput transcriptomic biomarker to address 21st century genetic toxicology
  needs" by Li et al. (2017) published in PNAS: Standard in vitro assays to assess
  genotoxicity frequently generate positive results that are subsequently found to
  be irrelevant for in vivo carcinogenesis and human cancer risk assessment. Currently
  used follow-up methods, such as animal testing, are expensive and time-consuming,
  and the development of approaches enabling more accurate mechanism-based risk assessment
  is essential. We developed an in vitro transcriptomic biomarker-based approach that
  provides a robust biomarker reflecting stress-signaling responses. The biomarker
  correctly identifies the vast majority of irrelevant genotoxicity results from in
  vitro chromosome damage assays. TGx-DDI, a multigene biomarker for DNA damage-inducing
  agents, is the first biomarker that not only shows convincing interlaboratory and
  intralaboratory reproducibility, but also performs accurately in a system suitable
  for high-throughput screening.'
