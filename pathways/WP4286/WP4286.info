Description: This pathway describes the transcriptomic biomarker TGx-DDI genotoxicity assay (consisting of 64 genes) developed to readily distinguish DNA damage-inducing (DDI) agents from non-DDI agents.   Abstract from the paper "Development and validation of a high-throughput transcriptomic biomarker to address 21st century genetic toxicology needs" by Li et al. (2017) published in PNAS: Standard in vitro assays to assess genotoxicity frequently generate positive results that are subsequently found to be irrelevant for in vivo carcinogenesis and human cancer risk assessment. Currently used follow-up methods, such as animal testing, are expensive and time-consuming, and the development of approaches enabling more accurate mechanism-based risk assessment is essential. We developed an in vitro transcriptomic biomarker-based approach that provides a robust biomarker reflecting stress-signaling responses. The biomarker correctly identifies the vast majority of irrelevant genotoxicity results from in vitro chromosome damage assays. TGx-DDI, a multigene biomarker for DNA damage-inducing agents, is the first biomarker that not only shows convincing interlaboratory and intralaboratory reproducibility, but also performs accurately in a system suitable for high-throughput screening.
