p-T19,S20-MRLC-smooth muscle/non-muscle myosin II	Complex	R-HSA-419195	Reactome	Nonmuscle myosin II (NMM2) is an actin-based motor protein that plays a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, including smooth muscle contraction, cell migration, polarity formation, and cytokinesis. NMM2 consists of two myosin heavy chains encoded by MYH9, MYH10, MYH14 (NMHC-IIA, B and C) or MYH11, two copies of MYL6 essential light chain protein, and two regulatory light chains (MRLCs), MYL9 and MYL12B. Myosin II activity is stimulated by phosphorylation of MRLC. Diphosphorylation at Thr-19 and Ser-20 (commonly referred in the literature as Thr-18 and Ser-19) increases both actin-activated Mg2+ ATPase activity and the stability of myosin II filaments; monophosphorylation at Ser-20 is less effective (Ikebe and Hartshorne 1985, Ikebe et al. 1988). Kinases responsible for the phosphorylation include myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), ROCK kinase, citron kinase, myotonic dystrophy kinase-related CDC42-binding protein kinase, and Zipper-interacting protein (ZIP) kinase. ROCK activity has been shown to regulate MRLC phosphorylation by directly mono- or diphosphorylating MRLC (Amano et al., 1996, Ueda et al., 2002, Watanabe et al. 2007).

Semaphorin
interactions	Pathway	R-HSA-373755	Reactome	Semaphorins are a large family of cell surface and secreted guidance molecules divided into eight classes on the basis of their structures. They all have an N-terminal conserved sema domain. Semaphorins signal through multimeric receptor complexes that include other proteins such as plexins and neuropilins.

p-T696,S852-MYPT1-Myosin Phosphatase	Complex	R-HSA-419085	Reactome	All known myosin phosphatases consist of PP1 beta and both a large and a small myosin phosphatase targetting (Mypt) subunit. The large Mypt targets PP1 beta to myosin and determines the substrate specifity of the phosphatase. The Large Mypt subunit is encoded by one of three human genes, PPP1R12A (MYPT1), PPP1R12B (MYPT2) and PPP1R12C. Only MYPT1 is represented here. The small subunit is an alternative transcript of MYPT2. The function of the small Mypt subunit remains unclear, but because it is known to interact directly with myosin and the large Mypt it is thought to have an unspecified regulatory role.

ROCK1,ROCK2	Complex	R-HSA-419057	Reactome	ROCK I (alternatively called ROK ?) and ROCK II (also known as Rho kinase or ROK ?) were originally isolated as RhoA-GTP interacting proteins. The kinase domains of ROCK I and ROCK II are 92% identical, and so far there is no evidence that they phosphorylate different substrates. RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC associate with and activate ROCK but other GTP-binding proteins can be inhibitors, e.g. RhoE, Rad and Gem. PDK1 kinase promotes ROCK I activity not through phosphorylation but by blocking RhoE association. PLK1 can phosphorylate ROCK II and this enhances the effect of RhoA. Arachidonic acid can activate ROCK independently of Rho.

Smooth
muscle/non-muscle
myosin II	Complex	R-HSA-419194	Reactome	Class 2 myosins are a set of protein complexes that bind actin and hydrolyse ATP, acting as molecular motors. They consist of two myosin heavy chains , two essential light chains and two regulatory light chains (MRLCs). Smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin isoforms are a subset of Class 2 myosin complexes. The nomenclature for isoforms is misleading, as non-muscle isoforms can be found in smooth muscle. The 4 smooth muscle isoforms all have heavy chains encoded by MYH11. The non-muscle isoforms have heavy chains encoded by MYH9, MYH10 or MYH14 (NMHC-IIA, B and C). The essential light chain (LC17) common to smooth and non-muscle isoforms is encoded by MYL6. The regulatory light chain (LC20) is encoded by either MYL9, giving a slightly more basic protein that is referred to as the smooth muscle LC20 isoform, and MRLC2, giving a more acidic isoform referred to as the non-muscle LC20 isoform.  

Class 2 myosins play a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, including cell migration, polarity formation, and cytokinesis. 
RHO GTPases activate
PAKs	Pathway	R-HSA-5627123	Reactome	The PAKs (p21-activated kinases) are a family of serine/threonine kinases mainly implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangements. All PAKs share a conserved catalytic domain located at the carboxyl terminus and a highly conserved motif in the amino terminus known as p21-binding domain (PBD) or Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain. There are six mammalian PAKs that can be divided into two classes: class I (or conventional) PAKs (PAK1-3) and class II PAKs (PAK4-6). Conventional PAKs are important regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility and are additionally implicated in transcription through MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades, death and survival signaling and cell cycle progression (Chan and Manser 2012).<p>PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3 are direct effectors of RAC1 and CDC42 GTPases. RAC1 and CDC42 bind to the CRIB domain. This binding induces a conformational change that disrupts inactive PAK homodimers and relieves autoinhibition of the catalytic carboxyl terminal domain (Manser et al. 1994, Manser et al. 1995, Zhang et al. 1998, Lei et al. 2000, Parrini et al. 2002; reviewed by Daniels and Bokoch 1999, Szczepanowska 2009). Autophosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the catalytic domain of PAKs (T423 in PAK1, T402 in PAK2 and T436 in PAK3) is necessary for the kinase activity of PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3. Autophosphorylation of PAK1 serine residue S144, PAK2 serine residue S141, and PAK3 serine residue S154 disrupts association of PAKs with RAC1 or CDC42 and enhances kinase activity (Lei et al. 2000, Chong et al. 2001, Parrini et al. 2002, Jung and Traugh 2005, Wang et al. 2011). LIMK1 is one of the downstream targets of PAK1 and is activated through PAK1-mediated phosphorylation of the threonine residue T508 within its activation loop (Edwards et al. 1999). Further targets are the myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), filamin, cortactin, p41Arc (a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex), caldesmon, paxillin and RhoGDI, to mention a few (Szczepanowska 2009).<p>Class II PAKs also have a CRIB domain, but lack a defined autoinhibitory domain and proline-rich regions. They do not require GTPases for their kinase activity, but their interaction with RAC or CDC42 affects their subcellular localization. Only conventional PAKs will be annotated here.
