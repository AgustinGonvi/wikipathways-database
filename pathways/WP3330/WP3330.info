description: IQGAPs constitute a family of scaffolding proteins characterized by a calponin homology (CH) domain, a polyproline binding region (WW domain), a tandem of four IQ (isoleucine and glutamine-rich) repeats and a RAS GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD). Three IQGAPs have been identified in human, IQGAP1, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3. The best characterized is IQGAP1 and over 90 proteins have been reported to bind to it. IQGAPs integrate multiple signaling pathways and coordinate a large variety of cellular activities (White et al. 2012). IQGAP proteins IQGAP1, IQGAP2 and IQGAP3, bind activated RHO GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 via their GRD and stabilize them in their GTP-bound state (Kuroda et al. 1996, Swart-Mataraza et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2007). IQGAPs bind F-actin filaments via the CH domain and modulate cell shape and motility through regulation of G-actin/F-actin equilibrium (Brill et al. 1996, Fukata et al. 1997, Bashour et al. 1997, Wang et al. 2007, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). Binding of IQGAPs to F-actin is inhibited by calmodulin binding to the IQ repeats (Bashour et al. 1997, Pelikan-Conchaudron et al. 2011). Based on IQGAP1 studies, IQGAPs presumably function as homodimers (Bashour et al. 1997).<p>IQGAP1 is involved in the regulation of adherens junctions through its interaction with E-cadherin (CDH1) and catenins (CTTNB1 and CTTNA1) (Kuroda et al. 1998, Hage et al. 2009). IQGAP1 contributes to cell polarity and lamellipodia formation through its interaction with microtubules (Fukata et al. 2002, Suzuki and Takahashi 2008).
