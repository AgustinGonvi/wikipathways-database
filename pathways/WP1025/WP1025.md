description: 'The functional B-cell receptor is a multi-protein complex consisting
  of an antigen binding subunit and a signaling subunit. The antigen binding subunit
  is the membrane bound immunoglobulin and the signaling subunit consists of the Igα
  and Igβ proteins, which are covalently bound to each other. Both Igα and Igβ proteins
  have an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based activation motif (ITAM) each in its cytoplasmic
  region, which is responsible for the initiation and propagation of signaling. Antigen
  binding to the immunoglubulin results in the aggregation of both the immunoglobulin
  and the Igα/β subunits. This results in the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues
  in the ITAM motif of the Igα/β subunits by the src-family of protein tyrosine kinases
  Lyn and Syk. The Src family kinases are initially in the proximity of the BCR as
  a result of membrane anchoring by virtue of its their acetylation. The N-terminal
  region of the kinases can also interact with the non-phosphorylated ITAMs of Igα.
  This association is further enhanced upon BCR engagement as a result of accumulation
  in BCR containing lipid rafts and SH2 domain mediated binding to the phosphorylated
  tyrosine residues in ITAMs. This increased association helps in amplifying the BCR
  mediated signaling. Doubly phosphorylated Igα/β ITAMs are necessary for efficient
  recruitment of Syk and its activation. Activated Syk then phsophorylates the adapter
  molecule B cell linker protein (BLNK), which acts as molecular scaffold for the
  recruitment of multiple effectors and hence the propagation of multiple signaling
  pathways. BLNK binds to Btk and PLCγ2 which results in optimal phosphorylation and
  activation of PLC. This is an important mechanism which links BCR to Ca2+ signaling.
  Apart from the PLC mediated Ca2+ signaling, BCR triggering also results in the the
  activaion of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K). This activation takes place
  through the recruitment of p85 adaptor subunit of PI-3K to CD19 co-receptor, which
  is phosphorylated by Lyn on its cytoplasmic Y-X-X-M motif. Alternatively, PI-3K
  can be recruited to the plasma membrane by other adapter molecules including PIK3AP,
  CBL or GAB1/2. PI-3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  to phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate. Akt, a serine threonine kinase, is
  recruited to the plasma membrane by virtue of its N-terminal PH-domain where it
  is activated by conformational changes and phosphorylation. Activated Akt phosphorylates
  several substrates resulting in diverse physiological consequences: Forkhead transcription
  factors - resulting in its degradation and hence inhibition of expression of pro-apoptotic
  genes, glycogen synthase kinase-3 GSK3 -leading to its inhibition and hence regulation
  of cell-cycle. The tanscription factor NF-kappaB is also found to be activated in
  BCR signaling in a Btk, PI-3K and PKC dependent manner.  BCR engagement can also
  result in the association of GRB2/SOS complex with either SHC or BLNK, which results
  in the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. This cascade leads to
  the activation of transcription factors including ELK and MYC. BCR activation also
  results in the activation of JNKs and p38MAPK.   Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/bcr_pathway.html
