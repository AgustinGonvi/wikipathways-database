description: This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has been
  demonstrated in another species.<p>The inference is based on Ensembl Compara orthology
  projection. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities (in input,
  output and catalyst) have a mapped ortholog or paralog are inferred to the other
  species. High-level events are also inferred for these events to allow for easier
  navigation.<p>Details of projection methods and parameters may be found <a href="/projection.html">here.</a><p>  Source:[http://plantreactome.gramene.org/
