description: The cytochrome P450-dependent formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid
  epoxides is an important biochemical pathway creating mediators of inflammation
  and blood pressure regulation.  Once formed these compounds can be incorperated
  into phospholipid membrance, and released by the action of phospholipase A2.  The
  epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatrieneoic acid or EETs, are putative
  endothelial derived hyperpolarization factors which increase the open state probability
  of Ca++ sensitive K+ channels, leading to vasodilation in arteriolar beds.  The
  11(12)-EET in particular appears to have potent functions in vasodilation, and are
  inhibitors of NFKb dependent inflammatory signalling, and PAI-1 activity.  The 5(6)-EET
  appears unique, in that its metabolic transformation through cyclooxygenase activities
  produces potent vasoconstrictors.  With the exception of the 5(6)-EET, these epoxy
  fatty acids are good substrates for the soluble epoxide hydrolase.  Hydrolytic tranformation
  to vicinal diols eliminates vasoactive actions, however these vicinal diols have
  been reported to have other biological activites, including PPAR-alpha activation.  Recent
  development of inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase are proving to have potent
  anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, and anti-nociceptive properties.  Reports
  of enzyme catalyzed glutathione-conjugates of the epoxy fatty acids have been reported,
  but the activity and relavance of these potential metabolic products are unknown
  to date.
