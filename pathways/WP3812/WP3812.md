description: Recruitment of receptors and ion channels to the postsynaptic membrane
  is the last step in synapse formation. Many of these proteins interact directly
  or indirectly with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1
  (PDZ) proteins, thus linking them to the postsynaptic scaffold and providing a mechanism
  for both retaining the protein at the synapse and keeping its proximity to signaling
  molecules known to associate with PDZ proteins (Nourry et al. 2003, Kim & Sheng
  2004, Montgomery et al. 2004, Sheng and Kim 2011). The synaptic adhesion-like molecules
  (SALM) family belongs to the superfamily of leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing
  adhesion molecules, alternatively referred as LRFN (leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin
  III domain-containing) is an synapse adhesion molecule linked to NMDA and AMPA receptors.
  It includes five known members (SALMs 1-5 or LRFN1-5), which have been implicated
  in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and branching, and synapse formation and
  maturation. SLAM proteins are distributed to both dendrites and axons in neurons
  (Ko et al. 2006, Wang et al. 2006, Morimura et al. 2006, Nam ett al. 2011). The
  family members, SALM1-SALM5, have a single transmembrane (TM) domain and contain
  extracellular leucine-rich repeats, an Ig C2 type domain, a fibronectin type III
  domain, and an intracellular postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1
  (PDZ) binding domain, which is present on all members except SALM4 and SALM5.  View
