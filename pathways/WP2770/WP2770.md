description: Carbonic anhydrases reversibly catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide
  and directly produce bicarbonate and protons, bypassing the formation of carbonic
  acid (reviewed in Lindskog 1997, Breton 2001, Esbaugh and Tufts 2006, Boron 2010,
  Gilmour 2010). Carbonic anhydrase deprotonates water to yield a zinc-hydroxyl group
  and a proton which is transferred to external buffer molecules via histidine or
  glutamate residues in carbonic anhydrase. The hydroxyl group reacts with carbon
  dioxide in the active site to yield bicarbonate. A water molecule displaces the
  bicarbonate and the reaction cycle begins again. There are currently 12 known active
  carbonic anhydrases in humans.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1475029
