description: Nicotinate (niacin) and nicotinamide are precursors of the coenzymes nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). When NAD+ and NADP+ are interchanged in a reaction with their reduced forms, NADH and NADPH respectively, they are important cofactors in several hundred redox reactions. Nicotinate is synthesized from 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde, an intermediate in the catabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan (Magni et al. 2004).
