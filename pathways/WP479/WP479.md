description: 'Chorismate, an intermediate in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids
  and the vitamins, p-aminobenzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate, is synthesized by the shikimate
  pathway. The shikimate pathway has been found to be common to all eukaryotes and
  prokaryotes studied thus far (as reported in (CITS:[1943992])).  In Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae the initial step is catalyzed by two deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate
  (DAHP) synthase isoenzymes, one of which (ARO3) is feedback inhibited by phenylalanine,
  and the other (ARO4) by tyrosine (CITS:[1943992]).  Both DAHP isoenzymes are derepressed
  by amino acid starvation (general control of amino acid biosynthesis) (CITS:[2906401]).  The
  5 subsequent reactions are catalyzed by the pentafunctional arom enzyme, Aro1p (CITS:[1943992][2825635]).  Aro1p
  is a mosaic of five monofunctional domains, each of which corresponds to one of
  five separate monofunctional E. coli enzymes (CITS:[1943992][2825635]).  The last
  step of chorismate biosynthesis, before the pathway branches to synthesize different
  terminal products, is catalyzed by Aro2p (CITS:[Jones][1943992]).  SOURCE: SGD pathways,
