description: 'This pathway illustrates signaling networks implicated in uterine muscle
  contraction at labor and quiescence throughout gestation (pregnancy). The muscle
  of the uterus, responsible for contractile activity is the myometrium. Genes in
  this pathway are either transcribed in myometrial muscle cells or act upon the myometrium
  to regulate contraction. The left half of this pathway illustrates pathways of myometrial
  relaxation that are active throughout normal gestation. These signaling events act
  to suppress coordinated contractions to prevent the early onset of labor at term,
  largely via activation of the adenylyl-cyclase thrhough G-protein coupled receptors.
  On the right side of this pathway are signaling componets involved in the activation
  of uterine contractions at labor, in particular, activation of calcium mobilization
  via Oxytocin mediated binding to the Oxytocin G-protein coupled receptor. Additional
  genes implicated in this pathway, based on microarray expression profiling of gestation,
  term and postpartum of term mice are also included (e.g., Guca2b, Rdc1, Edg2) have
  also been included. For a detailed description of this pathway see: http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/2/R12.    Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP289

    The presence of APREs in the OTR gene promoter suggests that the acute induction
    of OTR expression at the onset of parturition may be a phenomenon mechanistically
    similar to the fast induction of acute phase response genes. This notion is strengthened
    by the observation that the uterus is populated by macrophages and other specific
    lymphocytes (19,20).  Specifically, at term, nearly half of the decidual cells
    are of bone marrow origin (20).  IL-1beta released from macrophages stimulates
    the production and release of IL-6 by uterine stromal cells (21,22).  Moreover,
    IL- is a central pathophysiological mediator of infection-induced premature delivery
    (23), and preterm delivery can be prevented by an IL-1 antagonist in mice (24).  We
    speculate that under physiological as well as phathophysiological conditions,
    inflammatory cytokines are important inducers of labor and that this mechanism
    involves the cytokine-induced transcriptional activation of the OTR gene. :end
