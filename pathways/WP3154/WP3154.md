description: AMPK signaling pathway, a fuel sensor and regulator, promotes ATP-producing
  and inhibits ATP-consuming pathways in various tissues. AMPK is a heterotrimer composed
  of alpha-catalytic and beta and gamma-regulatory subunits. Humans and rodents have
  two alpha and beta and three gamma isoforms; some genes are subject to alternative
  splicing increasing the range of possible heterotrimer combinations. Cellular stresses
  that inhibit ATP production or increase its consumption change the AMP:ATP ratio
  and activate the pathway. AMPK activation by AMP is not completely understood; the
  current model states that binding of AMP to the gamma subunit leads to conformational
  changes that allosterically activate AMPK and render phosphorylated-Thr172 unavailable
  for inhibitory dephosphorylation. ATP antagonizes the effect of AMP; both AMP and
  ATP bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the Bateman (CBS) domains of the gamma
  subunit. The upstream kinase, known as Lkb1, is a complex of one catalytic and two
  regulatory subunits; Lkb1 is believed to be 'constitutively active'. In certain
  cell types, Thr172 can be phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
  kinases (CAmKK), in turn activated by calcium. A well known role of AMPK is in the
  regulation of lipid metabolism; it stimulates fatty acids oxidation and inhibits
  their synthesis. Phosphorylation by AMPK inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and
  results in reduced levels of malonyl-CoA product. Malonyl CoA is a substrate in
  the de novo synthesis of fatty acids and fatty acids elongation. Importantly, it
  is also an inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyl transferase I, required for the
  transfer of primed cytosolic fatty acids into the mitochondrion where they can undergo
  degradative beta-oxidation. AMPK inhibits mTOR signaling pathway by activating Tsc2
  and downstream of Tsc2 by inhibiting Raptor component of mTOR complex 1 [note that
  this effect is opposite to Tsc2 phosphorylation and inactivation by PI3K-Akt signaling
  downstream of insulin]. AMPK is also involved in promoting glucose uptake and utilization
  and integrates adipokynes and hormonal signals in both the hypothalamus and the
  periphery with potential impact on energy expenditure and uptake by molecular mechanisms
  that remain to be established. Due to its roles in fuel regulation, the AMPK pathway
  is regarded as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes type II, obesity and
  metabolic syndrome. As a note, drugs used in the treatment of insulin resistance
  and diabetes can activate AMPK.  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key
  role as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. The kinase is activated
  in response to stresses that deplete cellular ATP supplies such as low glucose,
  hypoxia, ischemia and heat shock. It exists as a heterotrimeric complex composed
  of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits. Binding of AMP to the
  γ subunit allosterically activates the complex, making it a more attractive substrate
  for its major upstream AMPK kinase, LKB1. Several studies indicate that signaling
  through adiponectin, leptin and CAMKKβ may also be important in activating AMPK.  As
  a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, AMPK activation positively
  regulates signaling pathways that replenish cellular ATP supplies. For example,
  activation of AMPK enhances both the transcription and translocation of GLUT4, resulting
  in an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, it also stimulates
  catabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis via inhibition of
  ACC and activation of PFK2. AMPK negatively regulates several proteins central to
  ATP consuming processes such as TORC2, glycogen synthase, SREBP-1 and TSC2, resulting
  in the downregulation or inhibition of gluconeogenesis, glycogen, lipid and protein
  synthesis. Due to its role as a central regulator of both lipid and glucose metabolism,
  AMPK is considered to be a key therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity,
  type II diabetes mellitus, and cancer.
