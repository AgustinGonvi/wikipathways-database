description: Pathways in physiological and pathological hypertrophy of the heart.
  Largely based on the article from Wang Y; ''Signal transduction in cardiac hypertrophy--dissecting
  compensatory versus pathological pathways utilizing a transgenic approach." Hypertrohpy
  of the heart can be a physiological compensation for exercise, but it can also be
  a pathological compensation for hypertension and stress.
