description: 'The neural cell adhesion molecule, NCAM, is a member of the immunoglobulin
  (Ig) superfamily and is involved in a variety of cellular processes of importance
  for the formation and maintenance of the nervous system. The role of NCAM in neural
  differentiation and synaptic plasticity is presumed to depend on the modulation
  of intracellular signal transduction cascades. NCAM based signaling complexes can
  initiate downstream intracellular signals by at least two mechanisms: (1) activation
  of FGFR and (2) formation of intracellular signaling complexes by direct interaction
  with cytoplasmic interaction partners such as Fyn and FAK. Tyrosine kinases Fyn
  and FAK interact with NCAM and undergo phosphorylation and this transiently activates
  the MAPK, ERK 1 and 2, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and transcription
  factors ELK and NFkB. CREB activates transcription of genes which are important
  for axonal growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity in neurons.<br><br>NCAM1 mediated
  intracellular signal transduction is represented in the figure below. The Ig domains
  in NCAM1 are represented in orange ovals and Fn domains in green squares. The tyrosine
  residues susceptible to phosphorylation are represented in red circles and their
  positions are numbered. Phosphorylation is represented by red arrows and dephosphorylation
  by yellow. Ig, Immunoglobulin domain; Fn, Fibronectin domain; Fyn, Proto-oncogene
  tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; RPTPalpha, Receptor-type
  tyrosine-protein phosphatase; Grb2, Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; SOS,
  Son of sevenless homolog; Raf, RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase;
  MEK, MAPK and ERK kinase; ERK, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MSK1, Mitogen
  and stress activated protein kinase 1; CREB, Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding
  protein; CRE, cAMP response elements.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=375165
