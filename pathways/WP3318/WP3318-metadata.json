  "description": "Target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a highly-conserved serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth and division in response to energy levels, growth signals, and nutrients (Zoncu et al. 2011). Control of mTOR activity is critical for the cell since its dysregulation leads to cancer, metabolic disease, and diabetes (Laplante & Sabatini 2012). In cells, mTOR exists as two structurally distinct complexes termed mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), each one with specificity for different sets of effectors. mTORC1 couples energy and nutrient abundance to cell growth and proliferation by balancing anabolic (protein synthesis and nutrient storage) and catabolic (autophagy and utilization of energy stores) processes.
