description: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2, superoxide anions and hydroxyl
  radicals interact with molecules in the cell causing damage that impairs cellular
  functions. Although cells have mechanisms to destroy ROS and repair the damage caused
  by ROS, it is considered to be a major factor in age-related diseases and the ageing
  process (Zhang & Weissbach 2008, Kim et al. 2014). ROS-scavenging systems include
  enzymes such as peroxiredoxins, superoxide dismutases, catalases and glutathione
  peroxidases exist to minimise the potential damage. <br><br>ROS reactions can also
  cause specific modifications to amino acid side chains that result in structural
  changes to proteins/enzymes. Methionine (Met) and cysteine (Cys) can be oxidised
  by ROS to sulfoxide and further oxidised to sulfone derivatives. Both free Met and
  protein-based Met are readily oxidized to form methionine sulphoxide (MetO) (Brot
  & Weissbach 1991). Many proteins have been demonstrated to undergo such oxidation
  and as a consequence have altered function (Levine et al. 2000). Sulphoxide formation
  can be reversed by the action of the methionine sulphoxide reductase system (MSR)
  which catalyses the reduction of MetO to Met (Brot et al. 1981). This repair uses
  one ROS equivalent, so MSR proteins can act as catalytic antioxidants, removing
  ROS (Levine et al. 1996). Methionine oxidation results in a mixture of methionine
  (S)-S- and (R)-S-oxides of methionine, diastereomers which are reduced by MSRA and
  MSRB, respectively. MSRA can reduce both free and protein-based methionine-(S)-S-oxide,
  whereas MSRB is specific for protein-based methionine-(R)-S-oxide. Mammals typically
  have only one gene encoding MSRA, but at least three genes encoding MSRBs (Hansel
  et al. 2005). Although structurally distinct, MRSA and MRSB share a common three-step
  catalytic mechanism. In the first step, the MSR catalytic cysteine residue interacts
  with the MetO substrate, which leads to product release and formation of the sulfenic
  acid. In the second step, an intramolecular disulfide bridge is formed between the
  catalytic cysteine and the regenerating cysteine. In the final step, the disulfide
  bridge is reduced by an electron donor, the NADPH-dependent thioredoxin/TR system,
  leading to the regeneration of the MSR active site (Boschi-Muller et al. 2008).<br><br>Beta-linked
  isoaspartyl (isoAsp) peptide bonds can arise spontaneously via succinimide-linked
  deamidation of asparagine (Asn) or dehydration of aspartate (Asp). Protein-L-isoaspartate
  (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (PCMT1, PIMT EC 2.1.1.77) transfers the methyl
  group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the alpha side-chain carboxyl group
  of L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartatyl amino acids. The resulting methyl ester undergoes
  spontaneous transformation to L-succinimide, which spontaneously hydrolyses to generates
  L-aspartyl residues or L-isoaspartyl residues (Knorre et al. 2009). This repair
  process helps to maintain overall protein integrity.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5676934
