description: Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) is divided into six subtypes of
  the disease. It is not known yet which gene is mutated to cause FPLD type 1. Type
  2 is caused by mutations in lamin A, which can be either through LMNA mutations
  or ZMPSTE24 mutations. Type 3 has been shown to be linked to PPARG mutations. The
  LIPE gene causes triacylglycerol breakdown. Mutations in this gene lead more breakdown
  and causes type 6 FPLD. CIDEC inhibits LIPE. Mutations in CIDEC lead to type 5 FPLD.
  PLIN1 stimulates CIDEC and mutations in this leads to type 4 FPLD.   The phenotype
  related to all types of FPLD, is a loss of adipose tissue in the limbs and some
  metabolic abnormalities. With FPLD type 1 there is a loss of subcutaneous fat from
  the limbs. Patients with type 2 have an increased muscularity and a loss of fat
  in the limbs. There is also an accumulation of fat in the face and neck. In type
  3 there is a loss of adipose tissue in the distal part of the limbs. Type 4 patients
  have shown to have small adipocytes, macrophage infiltration and fibrosis of adipose
  tissue. In type 5, there are small compartments in lipid droplets. Lastly, type
  6 FPLD shows an increased visceral fat, hepatosteatosis, insulin resistance, and
  diabetes. Some patients may show muscular dystrophy and elevated serum creatine
  phosphokinase
