description: Rhodopsin-like receptors (class A/1) are the largest group of GPCRs and are the best studied group from a functional and structural point of view. They show great diversity at the sequence level and thus, can be subdivided into 19 subfamilies (Subfamily A1-19) based on a phylogenetic analysis (Joost P and  Methner A, 2002). They represent members which include hormone, light and neurotransmitter receptors and encompass a wide range of functions including many autocrine, paracrine and endocrine processes.
