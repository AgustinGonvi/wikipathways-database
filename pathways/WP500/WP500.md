description: 'Glycogen is a very large, branched polymer of glucose residues. Within
  skeletal muscle and liver glucose is stored as glycogen. In the liver, glycogen
  synthesis and degradation are regulated to maintain blood-glucose levels as required
  to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. In contrast, in muscle, these processes
  are regulated to meet the energy needs of the muscle itself.   ''''''Glycogen synthesis''''''
  is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic. This means that glycogen synthesis requires
  the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from UTP, which reacts
  with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose
  pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose by the enzyme
  glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (a1->4)
  bonded glucose. As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing chain, the protein
  glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. The glycogen-branching
  enzyme, amylo (a1->4) to (a1->6) transglycosylase, catalyzes the transfer of a terminal
  fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group
  of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching
  enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may
  transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.  ''''''Glycogen degradation''''''
  consists of three steps: (1) the release of glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen, (2)
  the remodeling of the glycogen substrate to permit further degradation, and (3)
  the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate for further metabolism.  Information
  partly derived from "Biochemistry" by Stryer and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen
  Wikipedia].  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP500
