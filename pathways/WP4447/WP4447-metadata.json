  "description": "At least 17 nuclear receptors have been discovered to be SUMOylated (reviewed in Treuter and Venteclef 2011, Wadosky et al. 2012, Knutson and Lange 2013). In all but a few cases (notably AR and RORA) SUMOylation causes transcriptional repression. Repression by SUMOylation is believed to occur through several mechanisms: interference with DNA binding, recruitment of corepressors, retention of corepressors at non-target promoters (transrepression), re-localization of nuclear receptors within the nucleus, interference with dimerization of receptors, and interference (crosstalk) with other post-translational modifications. SUMOylation of receptors affects inflammation and disease processes (Anbalagan et al. 2012).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=4090294 Reactome].",
