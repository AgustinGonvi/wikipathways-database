MBP	Protein	A8MZH3	uniprot:A8MZH3	The classic group of MBP isoforms are the most abundant protein components of the myelin membrane in the CNS. They have a role in both its formation and stabilization. MBP: myelin basic protein.

MAG	Protein	P20916	uniprot:P20916	Adhesion molecule that mediates interactions between myelinating cells and neurons by binding to neuronal sialic acid-containing gangliosides and to the glycoproteins RTN4R and RTN4RL2 (By similarity). Not required for initial myelination, but seems to play a role in the maintenance of normal axon myelination. MAG: myelin associated glycoprotein.
PLP1	Protein	P60201	uniprot:P60201	This is the major myelin protein from the central nervous system. It plays an important role in the formation or maintenance of the multilamellar structure of myelin.
CNPase	Protein	P09543	uniprot:P09543	May participate in RNA metabolism in the myelinating cell, CNP is the third most abundant protein in central nervous system myelin. CNPase: 2,3-cyclic nucleotide 3phosphodiesterase.
Cerebrosides 22,7%	Metabolite	CHEBI:23079	ChEBI	Even though there are no absolute myelin-specific lipids, cerebroside, also known as galactosylceramide, is the most typical of myelin. The concentration of cerebroside in brain is directly proportional to the amount of myelin present. Cerebroside is not required for myelin formation but plays an important role in its insulating capacity and stability.
