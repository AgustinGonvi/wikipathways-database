description: In this final phase of mitosis, new membranes are formed around two sets
  of chromatids and two daughter cells are formed. The chromosomes and the spindle
  fibers disperse, and the fiber ring around the center of the cell, composed of actin,
  contracts, pinching the cell into two daughter cells.  View original pathway at
