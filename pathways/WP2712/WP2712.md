description: Abacavir is a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor with
  antiretroviral activity, widely used in combination with other drugs to treat HIV-1
  infection (Yuen et al. 2008). Its uptake across the plasma membrane is mediated
  by organic cation transporters SLC22A1, 2, and 3; the transport proteins ABCB1 and
  ABCG2 mediate its efflux. Abacavir itself is a prodrug. Activation requires phosphorylation
  by a cytosolic adenosine phosphotransferase and deamination by ADAL deaminase to
  yield carbovir monophosphate. Cytosolic nucleotide kinases convert carbovir monophosphate
  to carbovir triphosphate, the active HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Abacavir
  can be glucuronidated or oxidized to a 5'-carboxylate; these are the major forms
  in which it is excreted from the body.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=2161522
