  "description": "Abacavir is a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor with antiretroviral activity, widely used in combination with other drugs to treat HIV-1 infection (Yuen et al. 2008). Its uptake across the plasma membrane is mediated by organic cation transporters SLC22A1, 2, and 3; the transport proteins ABCB1 and ABCG2 mediate its efflux. Abacavir itself is a prodrug. Activation requires phosphorylation by a cytosolic adenosine phosphotransferase and deamination by ADAL deaminase to yield carbovir monophosphate. Cytosolic nucleotide kinases convert carbovir monophosphate to carbovir triphosphate, the active HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Abacavir can be glucuronidated or oxidized to a 5'-carboxylate; these are the major forms in which it is excreted from the body.
