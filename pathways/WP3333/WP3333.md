description: 'POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG bind elements in the promoters of target
  genes. The target genes of each transcription factor overlap extensively: POU5F1,
  SOX2, and NANOG co-occupy at least 353 genes (Boyer et al. 2005). About half of
  POU5F1 targets also bind SOX2 and about 90% of these also bind NANOG (Boyer et al.
  2005). Upon binding the transcription factors activate expression of one subset
  of target genes and repress another subset (Kim et al. 2006, Matoba et al. 2006,
  Player et al. 2006, Babaie et al. 2007). The targets listed in this module are those
  that have been described as composing activated genes in the core transcriptional
  network of pluripotent stem cells (Assou et al. 2007, Chavez et al. 2009, Jung et
  al. 2010). Inferences from mouse to human have been made with caution because of
  significant differences between the two species (Ginis et al. 2004).  View original
