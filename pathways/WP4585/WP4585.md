description: Immune checkpoints are hardwired into the immune system and are crucial
  for maintaining self-tolerance. Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves
  from immune system attacks.  One such immune checkpoint is PD-1 (programmed cell
  death 1 protein), which binds to its ligand PD-L1 and inhibits immune cell activity,
  including T cell activity. By upregulating PD-L1, cancer cells can inhibit T cells
  that might otherwise attack.  One strategy for cancer immunotherapy is to block
  this kind of negative feedback, thereby increasing anti-cancer T-cell activity.
  For the PD-1 checkpoint, cancer immunotherapeutics block either the PD-1 receptor,
  or the PD-L1 ligand. The [https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018/summary/
