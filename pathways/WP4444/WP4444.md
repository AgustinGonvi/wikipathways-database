description: Electrophilic oxo-derivatives of Ï‰-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ï‰-3
  PUFAs) are generated in macrophages and neutrophils in response to inflammation
  and oxidative stress to promote the resolution of inflammation. Being electrophilic,
  these derivatives reversibly bind to nucleophilic residues on target proteins (thiolates
  of cysteines and amino groups of histidine and lysine), triggering the activation
  of cytoprotective pathways. These include the Nrf2 antioxidant response, the heat
  shock response and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) and
  suppressing the NF-ÎºB proinflammatory pathway (Cipollina 2015). Thus, these electrophilic
  derivatives transduce anti-inflammatory actions rather than suppress the production
  of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites. An oxo-derivative of EPA has been
  shown to ablate leukemia stem cells in mice, which may represent a novel chemoprotective
  action for some oxo-derivatives (Hedge et al. 2011, Finch et al. 2015). In humans,
  dietary supplementation with Ï‰-3 PUFAs has been reported to increase the formation
  of oxo-derivatives (Yates et al. 2014). The enzymes cyclooxygenases (COX), lipoxygenases
  (LOs) and cytochromes P450s, acting alone or in concerted transcellular biosynthesis,
  initially form epoxy or hydroxy intermediates of Ï‰-3 PUFAs docosahexaenoic acid
  (DHA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) before these
  are further oxidised to electrophilic Î±,Î²-unsaturated keto-derivatives by cellular
  dehydrogenases.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9027604
