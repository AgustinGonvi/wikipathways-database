description: O-glycosylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM) required for correct functioning of many proteins (Van den Steen et al. 1998, Moremen et al. 2012). The O-glycosylation of proteins containing thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) domains and O-glycosylation of mucins are currently described here.
