description: Correctly folding proteins is a severely complicated process that fails
  at times, despite the controlled environment of the ER and numerous molecular helpers.
  Under normal conditions, these misfolded proteins are degraded through the ER-associated
  degradation (ERAD) mechanism. However, various physiological or environmental stressors
  can inhibit or overwhelm these normal mechanisms resulting in an increase in the
  amount of misfolded proteins, which trigger the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR).
  Organisms have evolved the UPR to handle this ER stress and suppress the toxicity
  of accumulated misfolded proteins (proteotoxicity). In mammals the UPR attenuates
  protein synthesis through PERK/PEK1 and increases transcription of folding and ERAD
  components through activation of potent transcription factors through IRE1 splicing
  of XBP1 mRNA and ER-stress cleavage of ATF-6. These events ultimately augment folding
  and enhance degradation capacity of the organelle. In C. elegans, the UPR also activates
  transcriptional regulators that reduce protein synthesis and increase the number
  of components necessary to deal with misfolded proteins.
