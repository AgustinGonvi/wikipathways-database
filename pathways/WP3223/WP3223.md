description: This pathway provides an overview of the directed differentiation molecules
  used to induce early and derivative cell lineages from human pluripotent stem cells.
  The initial version of this pathway is a direct adaptation of the SnapShot "Directed
  Differentiation of Pluripotent Stem Cells" pathway authored by Luis A. Williams,
  Brandi N. Davis-Dusenbery, and Kevin C. Eggan, HHMI, Harvard University, Cell 149,
  May 25, 2012 Elsevier Inc. DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.015. http://download.cell.com/pdf/PIIS0092867412005946.pdf.
  This adaptation was generated by Meenakshi Venkatasubramanian and Krithika Ramasamy
  Subramanian at Cincinnati Children's Hospital in the laboratory of Nathan Salomonis.
