description: This is a test pathway, to be used to test mappings to other databases,
  old system codes, etc. Each time a new metabolite mapping database is loaded onto
  the BridgeDb webservice that supports the linking on WikiPathways, this pathway
  should be opened and tested. The pathway has notes of the expected outcome.
