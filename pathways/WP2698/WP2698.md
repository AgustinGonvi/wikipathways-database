description: 'Meiotic recombination exchanges segments of duplex DNA between chromosomal
  homologs, generating genetic diversity (reviewed in Handel and Schimenti 2010, Inagaki
  et al. 2010, Cohen et al. 2006). There are two forms of recombination: non-crossover
  (NCO) and crossover (CO). In mammals, the former is required for correct pairing
  and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, while CO intermediates called chiasmata
  are required for correct segregation of bivalents.<br>Meiotic recombination is initiated
  by double-strand breaks created by SPO11, which remains covalently attached to the
  5'' ends after cleavage. SPO11 is removed by cleavage of single DNA strands adjacent
  to the covalent linkage. The resulting 5'' ends are further resected to produce
  protruding 3'' ends. The single-stranded 3'' ends are bound by RAD51 and DMC1, homologs
  of RecA that catalyze a search for homology between the bound single strand and
  duplex DNA of the chromosomal homolog. RAD51 and DMC1 then catalyze the invasion
  of the single strand into the homologous duplex and the formation of a D-loop heteroduplex.
  Approximately 90% of heteroduplexes are resolved without crossovers (NCO), probably
  by synthesis-dependent strand annealing.<br>The invasive strand is extended along
  the homolog and ligated back to its original duplex, creating a double Holliday
  junction. The mismatch repair proteins MSH4, MSH5 participate in this process, possibly
  by stabilizing the duplexes. The mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and MLH3 are then
  recruited to the double Holliday structure and an unidentified resolvase (Mus81?
  Gen1?) cleaves the junctions to yield a crossover. <br>Crossovers are not randomly
  distributed: The histone methyltransferase PRDM9 recruits the recombination machinery
  to genetically determined hotspots in the genome and each incipient crossover somehow
  inhibits formation of crossovers nearby, a phenomenon called crossover interference.
  Each chromosome bivalent, including the X-Y body in males, has at least one crossover
  and this is required for meiosis to proceed correctly.  View original pathway at
