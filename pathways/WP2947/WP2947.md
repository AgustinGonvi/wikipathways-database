description: 'This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has
  been demonstrated in another species.<p>The inference is based on Ensembl Compara
  orthology projection. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities
  (in input, output and catalyst) have a mapped ortholog or paralog are inferred to
  the other species. High-level events are also inferred for these events to allow
  for easier navigation.<p>Details of projection methods and parameters may be found
