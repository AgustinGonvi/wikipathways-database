  "description": "The B-WICH complex is a large 3 Mdalton complex containing SMARCA5 (SNF2H), BAZ1B (WSTF), ERCC6 (CSB), MYO1C (Nuclear myosin 1c), SF3B1, DEK, MYBBP1A, and DDX21 (Cavellan et al. 2006, Percipalle et al. 2006, Vintermist et al. 2001, Sarshad et al. 2013, Shen et al. 2013, reviewed in Percipalle and Farrants 2006). B-WICH is found at active rRNA genes as well as at 5S rRNA and 7SL RNA genes. B-WICH appears to remodel chromatin and recruit histone acetyltransferases that modify histones to transcriptionally active states.
