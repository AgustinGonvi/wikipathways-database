description: 'In biochemistry, eicosanoids are signaling molecules made by oxidation
  of twenty-carbon essential fatty acids, (EFAs). They exert complex control over
  many bodily systems, mainly in inflammation or immunity, and as messengers in the
  central nervous system. Source: [[wikipedia:Eicosanoid|Wikipedia]].  This pathway
  has been updated with information from LIPID MAPS>Eicosanoids [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php].
  Metabolites and proteins from this pathway are orange coloured and have an rounded
  rectangle shape (where an rectangle shape indicates that the node only occures in
  the LIPIDM APS pathway).  Reactions occurring in the LIPID MAPS pathways are coloured
  orange (where a dashed line indicates that the reaction only occures in the LIPID
  MAPS pathway).  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the
