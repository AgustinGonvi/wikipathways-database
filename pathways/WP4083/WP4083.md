description: Reelin (RELN) is an extracellular, multifunctional signal glycoprotein
  that controls not only the positioning of neurons in the developing brain, but also
  their growth, maturation, and synaptic activity in the adult brain (Stranahan et
  al. 2013). Abnormal Reelin expression in the brain is implicated in a number of
  neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
  Alzheimer's disease (Folsom & Fatemi  2013).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8866376
