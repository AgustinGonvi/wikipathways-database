  "description": "Reelin (RELN) is an extracellular, multifunctional signal glycoprotein that controls not only the positioning of neurons in the developing brain, but also their growth, maturation, and synaptic activity in the adult brain (Stranahan et al. 2013). Abnormal Reelin expression in the brain is implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease (Folsom & Fatemi  2013).
