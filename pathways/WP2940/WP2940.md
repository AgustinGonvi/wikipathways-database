description: Polar auxin transport pathway of rice. Even though we have shown a representative
  diagram of influx and efflux proteins on different but adjacent cells, the auxin
  influx and efflux transport proteins when present in the same cell, are often located
  in the plasma membrane of cell's opposite side or on the sides (left/right). All
  the different paralogs of influx and efflux proteins may not be present in the same
  cell. Often their expression and localization is tissue, cell, organ and development
  stage specific. This helps in directing the flow of auxin towards 'auxin maxima'
  sites in plant organs and cells as needed. In some cases auxin can permeate through
  the plasma membrane.
