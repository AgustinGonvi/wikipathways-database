description: Endothelin is a strong peptide well known for its vasoconstriction activities. It is known for regulating extensive physiological and pathophysiological activities with beneficial and detrimental roles in mammals.To develop this network map of endothelin mediated signalling pathway, We searched term retrieved 2,800 papers in Pubmed were used for initial screening. Of these, 640 research articles were screened for endothelin mediated reactions and selected for annotation. Out of these, 334 articles had information which are compatible to endothelin mediated signalling were selected for further curation. The manual curation of selected articles documented 90 activation / inhibition events, 98 PTM or catalysis events, 56molecular associations, 239 gene regulation events, 145 types of protein expression and 27 protein translocation events.
