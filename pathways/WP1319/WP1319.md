description: IL-2 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic effects on several
  cells of the immune system. IL-2 was originally discovered as a T cell growth factor,
  but it was also found to have actions related to B cell proliferation, and cytolytic
  activity of natural killer cells. IL-2 also activates lymphokine activated killer
  cells. In contrast to its proliferative effects, IL-2 also has potent activity in
  a process known as activation-induced cell death. More recently, IL-2 was shown
  to promote tolerance through its effects on regulatory T cell development. IL-2
  clinically has anti-cancer effects as well as utility in supporting T cell numbers
  in HIV/AIDS. There are three classes of IL-2 receptors, binding IL-2 with low, intermediate,
  or high-affinity. The low affinity receptor (IL-2Rα alone) is not functional; signaling
  by IL-2 involves either the high affinity hetero-trimeric receptor containing IL-2Rα,
  IL-2Rβ and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (originally named IL-2Rγ and
  now generally denoted as γc) or the intermediate affinity heterodimeric receptor
  composed of IL-2Rβ and γc. IL-2 stimulation induces the activation of the Janus
  family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK3, which associate with IL-2Rβ and γc, respectively.
  These kinases in turn phosphorylate IL-2Rβ and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of
  STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and various other downstream
  targets. The downstream signaling pathways activated by IL-2 also involves mitogen-activated
  protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling modules, leading to both
  mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals. Please access this pathway at [http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_2_pathway.html
