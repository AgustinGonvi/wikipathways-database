  Escherichia coli (commonly abbreviated E. coli) is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium
  that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms).
  Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes are pathogenic and can cause
  serious food poisoning in humans, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls.
  E. coli are also responsible for a majority of cases of urinary tract infections.
  The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their
  hosts by producing vitamin K2, and by preventing the establishment of pathogenic
  bacteria within the intestine.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available
  via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2272 CPTAC Assay Portal]'
