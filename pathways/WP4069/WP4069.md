description: Diverse molecules of host-cell origin may serve as endogenous ligands
  of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Erridge C 2010; Piccinini AM & Midwood KS 2010).
  These molecules are known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs
  are immunologically silent in healthy tissues but become active upon tissue damage
  during both infectious and sterile insult. DAMPs are released from necrotic cells
  or secreted from activated cells in response to tissue damage to mediate tissue
  repair by promoting inflammatory responses. However, DAMPs have also been implicated
  in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid
  arthritis (RA), cancer, and atherosclerosis. The mechanism underlying the switch
  from DAMPs that initiate controlled tissue repair, to those that mediate chronic,
  uncontrolled inflammation is still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that an abnormal
  increase in protein citrullination is  involved in disease pathophysiology (Anzilotti
  C et al. 2010; Sanchez-Pernaute O et al. 2013; Sokolove J et al. 2011; Sharma P
  et al. 2012). Citrullination is a post-translational modification event mediated
  by peptidyl-arginine deaminase enzymes which catalyze the deimination of proteins
  by converting arginine residues into citrullines in the presence of calcium ions.  View
