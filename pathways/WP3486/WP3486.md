description: Somatic mutations affecting arginine residue 132 of IDH1 (isocitrate
  dehydrogenase 1, a cytosolic enzyme that normally catalyzes the NADP+-dependent
  conversion of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate), are very commonly found in human glioblastomas
  (Parsons et al. 2008). These mutant proteins efficiently catalyze the NADPH-dependent
  reduction of 2-oxoglutarate to form 2-hydroxyglutarate. Cells expressing the mutant
  protein accumulate elevated levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate, probably in the cytosol
  as IDH1 is a cytosolic enzyme. The fate of the 2-hydroxyglutarate is unclear, but
  the high frequency with which the mutation is found in surveys of primary tumors
  is consistent with the possibility that it is advantageous to the tumor cells (Dang
  et al 2009).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=2978092
