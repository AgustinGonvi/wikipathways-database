description: 'In response to exposure to elevated temperature and certain other proteotoxic
  stimuli (e.g., hypoxia, free radicals) cells activate a number of cytoprotective
  mechanisms known collectively as "heat shock response".  Major aspects of the heat
  shock response (HSR) are evolutionarily conserved events that allow cells to recover
  from protein damage induced by stress (Liu XD et al. 1997; Voellmy R & Boellmann
  F 2007;  Shamovsky I & Nudler E 2008; Anckar J & Sistonen L 2011). The main hallmark
  of HSR is the dramatic alteration of the gene expression pattern. A diverse group
  of protein genes is induced by the exposure to temperatures 3-5 degrees higher than
  physiological. Functionally, most of these genes are molecular chaperones that ensure
  proper protein folding and quality control to maintain cell proteostasis.<p>At the
  same time, heat shock-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha
  leads to the shutdown of the nascent polypeptide synthesis reducing the burden on
  the chaperone system that has to deal with the increased amount of misfolded and
  thermally denatured proteins (Duncan RF & Hershey JWB 1989; Sarkar A et al. 2002;  Spriggs
  KA et al. 2010).<p>The induction of HS gene expression primarily occurs at the level
  of transcription and is mediated by heat shock transcription factor HSF1(Sarge KD
  et al. 1993; Baler R et al. 1993). Human cells express five members of HSF protein
  family: HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSFX and HSFY. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat
  inducible gene expression (Zuo J et al. 1995; Akerfelt M et al. 2010). HSF2 is activated
  in response to certain developmental stimuli in addition to being co-activated with
  HSF1 to provide promoter-specific fine-tuning of the HS response by forming heterotrimers
  with HSF1 (Ostling P et al. 2007; Sandqvist A et al. 2009). HSF4 lacks the transcription
  activation domain and acts as a repressor of certain genes during HS (Nakai A et
  al. 1997; Tanabe M et al. 1999; Kim SA et al. 2012). Two additional family members
  HSFX and HSFY, which are  located on the X and Y chromosomes respectively, remain
  to be characterized (Bhowmick BK et al. 2006; Shinka T et al. 2004; Kichine E et
  al. 2012).<p>Under normal conditions HSF1 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus
  in the form of an inactive monomer. The monomeric state of HSF1 is maintained by
  an intricate network of protein-protein interactions that include the association
  with HSP90 multichaperone complex, HSP70/HSP40 chaperone machinery, as well as intramolecular
  interaction of two conserved hydrophobic repeat regions. Monomeric HSF1 is constitutively
  phosphorylated on Ser303 and Ser 307 by (Zou J et al. 1998; Knauf U et al. 1996;
  Kline MP & Moromoto RI 1997; Guettouche T et al. 2005). This phosphorylation plays
  an essential role in ensuring cytoplasmic localization of at least a subpopulation
  of HSF1 molecules under normal conditions (Wang X et al. 2004).<p>Exposure to heat
  and other proteotoxic stimuli results in the release of HSF1 from the inhibitory
  complex with chaperones and its subsequent trimerization, which is promoted by its
  interaction with translation elongation factor eEF1A1 (Baler R et al. 1993; Shamovsky
  I et al. 2006; Herbomel G et al 2013). The trimerization is believed to involve
  intermolecular interaction between hydrophobic repeats 1-3 leading to the formation
  of a triple coil structure. Additional stabilization of the HSF1 trimer is provided
  by the formation of intermolecular S-S bonds between Cys residues in the DNA binding
  domain (Lu M et al.2008). Trimeric HSF1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus
  where it binds the specific sequence in the promoter of hsp genes (Sarge KD et al.
  1993; Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994). The binding sequence for HSF1 (HSE, heat shock
  element) contains series of inverted repeats nGAAn in head-to-tail orientation,
  with at least three elements being required for the high affinity binding. Binding
  of the HSF1 trimer to the promoter is not sufficient to induce transcription of
  the gene (Cotto J et al. 1996). In order to do so, HSF1 needs to undergo inducible
  phosphorylation on specific Ser residues such as Ser230, Ser326. This phosphorylated
  form of HSF1 trimer is capable of increasing the promoter initiation rate. HSF1
  bound to DNA promotes recruiting components of the transcription mediator complex
  and  relieving promoter-proximal pause of RNA polymerase II through its interaction
  with TFIIH transcription factor (Yuan CX & Gurley WB 2000).<p>HSF1 activation is
  regulated in a precise and tight manner at multiple levels (Zuo J et al. 1995; Cotto
  J et al. 1996). This allows fast and robust activation of HS response to minimize
  proteotoxic effects of the stress. The exact set of HSF1 inducible genes is probably
  cell type specific. Moreover, cells in different pathophysiological states will
  display different but overlapping profile of HS inducible genes.  View original
