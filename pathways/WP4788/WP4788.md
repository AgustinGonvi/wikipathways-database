description: 'Taken from Osteopetrosis: genetics, treatment and new insights into
  osteoclast function by Cristina Sobacchi, Ansgar Schulz, Fraser P. Coxon, Anna Villa
  and Miep H. Helfrich [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877423].  The osteopetroses
  are genetic diseases characterized by increased bone mass and density due to a failure
  in bone resorption. Two major forms can be distinguished on the basis of their mode
  of inheritance: autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO, formerly known as Albers-Schönberg
  disease), is usually considered an adult-onset, more benign form (and has been comprehensively
  reviewed elsewhere); whereas autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), also termed
  malignant infantile osteopetrosis, presents soon after birth, is often severe and
  leads to death if left untreated.  Mechanisms underlying osteoclast-‑rich ARO: Ruffled
  border formation and bone resorption by osteoclasts are dependent on secretory lysosome
  trafficking. Genes implicated in osteoclast-‑rich autosomal recessive osteopetrosis
  encode proteins that localize to secretory lysosomes in osteoclasts. TCIRG1 encodes
  the a3 subunit of the V0 complex, part of the V‑ATPase proton pump that acidifies
  endosomes and lysosomes; CLCN7 encodes ClC‑7, the Cl– antiporter responsible for
  increasing lumenal Cl– concentration; OSTM1 encodes the β‑subunit of CIC‑7; PLEKHM1
  encodes a cytosolic protein that binds to the active (GTP-‑bound) form of Rab7,
  which is associated with late endosomes and lysosomes; and SNX10 encodes sorting
  nexin 10, which localizes to endosomes via a phosphoinositide-‑binding PX domain.
  This domain also interacts with the V1 complex D subunit of V‑ATPase, raising the
  possibility that SNX10 is involved in trafficking of V‑ATPase. ARO-‑causing mutations
  in all five genes disrupt trafficking of secretory lysosomes, thereby impairing
  ruffled-‑border formation and bone resorption. Osteoclast formation and adhesion
  to bone through the sealing zone are unaffected.  Mechanisms underlying osteoclast-‑poor
  ARO: Osteoclastogenesis is dependent on the RANK signalling pathway. In normal osteoclasts,
  binding of RANKL recruits TRAF6, which releases NFκB from its phosphorylated inhibitor
  IκB. NFκB translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of key osteoclast
  genes. Osteopetrosis-‑causing mutations in TNFRSF11A (which encodes RANK) either
  reduce protein expression at the plasma membrane  or impair RANKL binding, which
  leads to the loss of NFκB signalling and prevents differentiation and fusion of
  osteoclast precursors. Similarly, osteoclast differentiation defects are seen if
  osteopetrosis-‑causing mutations in TNFSF11 (which encodes RANKL) are present. Mutations
  identified so far lead to reduced RANKL trimerization or impaired RANK binding.
  Osteoclast formation studies in vitro reveal these two distinct osteoclast-‑poor
  forms of ARO: those in which osteoclastogenesis cannot be induced by synthetic RANKL
  (TNFRSF11A-‑related ARO) and those in which osteoclastogenesis can be induced by
  synthetic RANKL, resulting in osteoclasts that function normally (TNFSF11-‑related
  ARO).   Linked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused
  by mutation in the respective gene.'
