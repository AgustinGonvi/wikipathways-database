description: Protein sorting during formation of multivesicular bodies results in
  packaging of key molecules in exosomes. Exosomes bound-signaling ligands once released
  from host cells interacts with the receptors on the recipient cells to induce downstream
  signaling cascades pivotal in the initiation and progression of cancer. This horizontal
  transfer of proteomic content of exosomes can mediate signaling pathways including
  Wnt, PI3K and TGF-beta in recipient cells.
