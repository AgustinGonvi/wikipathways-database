description: 'Diagrammatic scheme depicting targeted p53 pathway-related genes by
  upregulated miRNAs in prostate tumor cells. An integrated in silico and computational
  prediction databases (DIANA-micro T-CDS, miRBase, and TargetScan) were employed
  section to predict potential targets of a subset of highly upregulated miRNAs (>2-fold)
  in prostate tumors.  Note that some targeting miRNAs were removed from the original
  publication figure for clarity. These are represented in supplementary table S3:
  http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1535370216681554.  Proteins on this
  pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3982
