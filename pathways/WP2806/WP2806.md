description: The complement activation takes place through one or more of the well-established
  (alternative, classical or lectin) pathways consisting of plasma and membrane-bound
  proteins. All three pathways converge at the level of complement C3 [https://doi.org/10.6072/H0.MP.A004235.01]
  and are controlled by regulators [https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.1923]. Complement C3
  belongs to the alpha-2-macroglobulin family of proteins, and consists of a alpha-chain
  and an beta-chain. Cleavage of C3 which can be initiated by one or more of the above
  three distinct pathways, into C3b[Proteolysis@23-667,749-1663] and C3a [Proteolysis@672-748]
  is an important step in the complement activation cascade. Classical and lectin
  pathways, when activated with recognition of pathogens (or immune complexes) use
  C3-convertase [C4b2a] to cleave complement C3 into C3a and C3b [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.125.2.359].
  However, in alternative pathway a small fraction of the C3 molecules are hydrolyzed
  to C3(H20) exposing new binding sites. This hydrated C3 [C3(H20)] recruits complement
  factor B [fB], which is then cleaved by complement factor D [fD] to result in formation
  of the minor form of C3-convertase [C3(H20)Bb] that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b
  [https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.154.3.856]. Further, addition of C3b to C3 convertase
  [C3bBb or C4b2a] results in C5 convertase [C3bBb3b or C4b2a3b], that cleaves complement
  C5 to C5a and C5b, is the last enzymatic step of the complement activation cascade
  [https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.273.27.16828][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2387864].
  During complement activation C5b interacts with complement C6, C7, C8 and C9 in
  a sequential and non-catalyzed manner to result in the formation of Terminal Complement
  Complex (TCC) [https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.219766]. The entire network is considered
  as a simple recognition and elimination system of host-immune complexes and apoptotic
  and/or pathogens, and therefore promotes host immune homeostasis. The complement
  system is also involved in cross-talk with other processes related to coagulation,
  lipid metabolism and cancer. However, many pathogens counteract complement attack
  through a range of different mechanisms, such acquisition of host complement regulators
  to the surface of pathogen, or secretion of complement inactivation factors. In
  order to have a holistic view of the entire complement network, Dr. John D.Lambris
  group (University of Pennsylvania) developed the Complement Map Database (CMAP)
  which is a unique repository focused on documented molecular interactions described
  within the complement cascade and between complement and other biological systems.

  is entirely based on published experimental data and is fully revised by experts
  in the field. Further, the Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages -SGMP-( https://escholarship.org/uc/molecule_pages)[https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btr190]
