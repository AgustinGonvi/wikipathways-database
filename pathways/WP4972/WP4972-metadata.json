  "description": "In contrary to the vesicle-mediated macroautophagy, the chaperone mediated mechanism of autophagy selectively targets individual proteins to the lysosome for degradation. Chaperones bind intracellular proteins based on recognition motifs and transports them from the cytosol to the lysosomal membrane. Subsequently, the protein is translocated into the lumen for digestion (Cuervo A M et al. 2014, Kaushik S et al. 2018).
