description: Overview of the leukotrienes biosynthesis and metabolism. Leukotrienes
  are a group of biologically active lipid mediators who are derived pre-dominantly
  from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygensea pathways. They pathways splits up into
  two parts, one include cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4), and second
  contains LTB4.   The three disorders in the biosynthesis and metabolism of leukotrienes
  are caused by hereditary primary defects in enzyme and are indicated with a light
  red color. The clinical presentation of LTC4 synthase deficiency includes muscular
  hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, microcephaly and failure to thrive. The other
  two defects gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency and membrane-bound dipeptidase
  deficiency, have been less well studied.  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 41
  of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
