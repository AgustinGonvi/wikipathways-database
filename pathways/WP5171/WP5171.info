description: Overview of the leukotrienes biosynthesis and metabolism. Leukotrienes are a group of biologically active lipid mediators who are derived pre-dominantly from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygensea pathways. They pathways splits up into two parts, one include cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4), and second contains LTB4.   The three disorders in the biosynthesis and metabolism of leukotrienes are caused by hereditary primary defects in enzyme and are indicated with a light red color. The clinical presentation of LTC4 synthase deficiency includes muscular hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, microcephaly and failure to thrive. The other two defects gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency and membrane-bound dipeptidase deficiency, have been less well studied.  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 41 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
