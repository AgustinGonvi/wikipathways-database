description: 'The TGF-beta/BMP pathway incorporates several signaling pathways that
  share most, but not all, components of a central signal transduction engine. The
  general signaling scheme is rather simple: upon binding of a ligand, an activated
  plasma membrane receptor complex is formed, which passes on the signal towards the
  nucleus through a phosphorylated receptor SMAD (R-SMAD). In the nucleus, the activated
  R-SMAD promotes transcription in complex with a closely related helper molecule
  termed Co-SMAD (SMAD4). However, this simple linear pathway expands into a network
  when various regulatory components and mechanisms are taken into account. The signaling
  pathway includes a great variety of different TGF-beta/BMP superfamily ligands and
  receptors, several types of the R-SMADs, and functionally critical negative feedback
  loops. The R-SMAD:Co-SMAD complex can interact with a great number of transcriptional
  co-activators/co-repressors to regulate positively or negatively effector genes,
  so that the interpretation of a signal depends on the cell-type and cross talk with
  other signaling pathways such as Notch, MAPK and Wnt. The pathway plays a number
  of different biological roles in the control of embryonic and adult cell proliferation
  and differentiation, and it is implicated in a great number of human diseases.<br>TGF
  beta (TGFB1) is secreted as a homodimer, and as such it binds to TGF beta receptor
  II (TGFBR2), inducing its dimerization. Binding of TGF beta enables TGFBR2 to form
  a stable hetero-tetrameric complex with TGF beta receptor I homodimer (TGFBR1).
  TGFBR2 acts as a serine/threonine kinase and phosphorylates serine and threonine
  residues within the short GS domain (glycine-serine rich domain) of TGFBR1.<br>The
  phosphorylated heterotetrameric TGF beta receptor complex (TGFBR) internalizes into
  clathrin coated endocytic vesicles where it associates with the endosomal membrane
  protein SARA. SARA facilitates the recruitment of cytosolic SMAD2 and SMAD3, which
  act as R-SMADs for TGF beta receptor complex. TGFBR1 phosphorylates recruited SMAD2
  and SMAD3, inducing a conformational change that promotes formation of R-SMAD trimers
  and dissociation of R-SMADs from the TGF beta receptor complex. <br>In the cytosol,
  phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 associate with SMAD4 (known as Co-SMAD), forming
  a heterotrimer which is more stable than the R-SMAD homotrimers. R-SMAD:Co-SMAD
  heterotrimer translocates to the nucleus where it directly binds DNA and, in cooperation
  with other transcription factors, regulates expression of genes involved in cell
  differentiation, in a context-dependent manner. <br>The intracellular level of SMAD2
  and SMAD3 is regulated by SMURF ubiquitin ligases, which target R-SMADs for degradation.
  In addition, nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimer stimulates transcription of inhibitory
  SMADs (I-SMADs), forming a negative feedback loop. I-SMADs bind the phosphorylated
  TGF beta receptor complexes on caveolin coated vesicles, derived from the lipid
  rafts, and recruit SMURF ubiquitin ligases to TGF beta receptors, leading to ubiquitination
  and degradation of TGFBR1. Nuclear R-SMAD:Co-SMAD heterotrimers are targets of nuclear
  ubiquitin ligases which ubiquitinate SMAD2/3 and SMAD4, causing heterotrimer dissociation,
  translocation of ubiquitinated SMADs to the cytosol and their proteasome-mediated
  degradation. For a recent review of TGF-beta receptor signaling, please refer to
