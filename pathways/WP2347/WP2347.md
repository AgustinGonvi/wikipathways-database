description: Pantothenate is the precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), the acyl carrier in
  scores of reactions. Pantothenate is made in the cytosol from pantoate and β-alanine,
  then converted to CoA in five steps, all probably cytosolic (Webb and Smith, 2011);
  the fifth step may also occur in plastids and peroxisomes. The three-step pathway
  to pantoate is not fully defined, but it is clear that step two, conversion of α-keto-isovalerate
  to ketopantoate, is mitochondrial (Ottenhof et al., 2004). Step one, α-keto-isovalerate
  formation from valine, is thus likely catalyzed by a mitochondrial branched chain
  aminotransferase (Taylor et al., 2004). The enzyme for step three (ketopantoate
  reduction to pantoate) is not known, so it is unclear whether this step is located
  in mitochondria or the cytosol. The details of the pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis
  (especially their compartmentalization) in plants are far from being elucidated.
  This diagram is an attempt to capture the current state of the field
