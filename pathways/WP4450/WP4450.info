description: Several ubiquitin E3 ligases are regulated by SUMOylation (reviewed in Wilson and Heaton 2008). SUMOylation appears to be necessary for nuclear import of MDM2, the E3 ligase that ubiquitinylates TP53 (p53). SUMOylation of VHL abolishes its ubiquitin ligase activity. HERC2, RNF168, and BRCA1 are ubiquitin ligases that are SUMOylated during DNA damage response and repair.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=3232142 Reactome].
