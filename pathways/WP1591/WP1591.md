description: This pathway has been largely adapted from an article by Deepak Srivastava,
  Cell. 2006 Sep 22;126(6):1037-48. In this pathway are known transcription factors,
  miRNAs, and regulatory proteins that impact the regional specificity of the human
  heart. Activating signals are indicated by arrows while inhibitory signals are indicated
  by T-bars. Special thanks to Kim Cordes for her assistance in revising this pathway,
  based on recent heart development research.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1591
