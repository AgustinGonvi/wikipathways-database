description: Elastic fibres (EF) are a major structural constituent of dynamic connective
  tissues such as large arteries and lung parenchyma, where they provide essential
  properties of elastic recoil and resilience. EF are composed of a central cross-linked
  core of elastin, surrounded by a mesh of microfibrils, which are composed largely
  of fibrillin. In addition to elastin and fibrillin-1, over 30 ancillary proteins
  are involved in mediating important roles in elastic fibre assembly as well as interactions
  with the surrounding environment. These include fibulins, elastin microfibril interface
  located proteins (EMILINs), microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs) and Latent
  TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBPs). Fibulin-5 for example, is expressed by vascular
  smooth muscle cells and plays an essential role in the formation of elastic fibres
  through mediating interactions between elastin and fibrillin (Yanigasawa et al.
  2002, Freeman et al. 2005). In addition, it plays a role in cell adhesion through
  integrin receptors and has been shown to influence smooth muscle cell proliferation
  (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Nakamura et al. 2002). EMILINs are a family of homologous
  glycoproteins originally identified in extracts of aortas. Found at the elastin-fibrillin
  interface, early studies showed that antibodies to EMILIN can affect the process
  of elastic fibre formation (Bressan et al. 1993). EMILIN1 has been shown to bind
  elastin and fibulin-5 and appears to coordinate their common interaction (Zanetti
  et al. 2004). MAGPs are found to co-localize with microfibrils. MAGP-1, for example,
  binds strongly to an N-terminal sequence of fibrillin-1. Other proteins found associated
  with microfibrils include vitronectin (Dahlback et al. 1990).<br><br>Fibrillin is
  most familiar as a component of elastic fibres but microfibrils with no elastin
  are found in the ciliary zonules of the eye and invertebrate circulatory systems.
  The addition of elastin to microfibrils is a vertebrate adaptation to high pulsatile
  pressures in their closed circulatory systems (Faury et al. 2003). Elastin appears
  to have emerged after the divergence of jawless vertebrates from other vertebrates
  (Sage 1982). <br><br>Fibrillin-1 is the major structural component of microfibrils.
  Fibrillin-2 is expressed earlier in development than fibrillin-1 and may be important
  for elastic fiber formation (Zhang et al. 1994). Fibrillin-3 arose as a duplication
  of fibrillin-2 that did not occur in the rodent lineage. It was first isolated from
  human brain (Corson et al. 2004).<br><br>Fibrillin assembly is not as well defined
  as elastin assembly. The primary structure of fibrillin is dominated by calcium
  binding epidermal growth factor like repeats (Kielty et al. 2002). Fibrillin may
  form dimers or trimers before secretion. However, multimerisation predominantly
  occurs outside the cell. Formation of fibrils appears to require cell surface structures
  suggesting an involvement of cell surface receptors. Fibrillin is assembled pericellularly
  (i.e. on or close to the cell surface) into microfibrillar arrays that undergo time
  dependent maturation into microfibrils with beaded-string appearance. Transglutaminase
  forms gamma glutamyl epsilon lysine isopeptide bonds within or between peptide chains.
  Additionally, intermolecular disulfide bond formation between fibrillins is an important
  contributor to fibril maturation (Reinhardt et al. 2000).<br><br>Models of fibrillin-1
  microfibril structure suggest that the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 is asymmetrically
  exposed in outer filaments, while the C-terminal half is buried in the interior
  (Kuo et al. 2007). Fibrillinopathies include Marfan syndrome, familial ectopia lentis,
  familial thoracic aneurysm, all due to mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene FBN1,  and
  congenital contractural arachnodactyly which is caused by mutation of FBN2 (Maslen
  & Glanville 1993, Davis & Summers 2012).<br><br>In vivo assembly of fibrillin requires
  the presence of extracellular fibronectin fibres (Sabatier et al. 2009). Fibrillins
  have Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences that interact with integrins (Pfaff et al. 1996,
  Sakamoto et al. 1996, Bax et al., 2003, Jovanovic et al. 2008) and heparin-binding
  domains that interact with a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (Tiedemann
  et al. 2001) possibly a syndecan (Ritty et al. 2003). Fibrillins also have a major
  role in binding and sequestering growth factors such as TGF beta into the ECM  (Neptune
  et al. 2003). Proteoglycans such as versican (Isogai et al. 2002), biglycan, and
  decorin (Reinboth et al. 2002) can interact with the microfibrils. They confer specific
  properties including hydration, impact absorption, molecular sieving, regulation
  of cellular activities, mediation of growth factor association, and release and
  transport within the extracellular matrix (Buczek-Thomas et al. 2002). In addition,
  glycosaminoglycans have been shown to interact with tropoelastin through its lysine
  side chains (Wu et al. 1999), regulating tropoelastin assembly (Tu & Weiss 2008).<br><br>Elastin
  is synthesized as a 70kDa monomer called tropoelastin, a highly hydrophobic protein
  composed largely of two types of domains that alternate along the polypeptide chain.
  Hydrophobic domains are rich in glycine, proline, alanine, leucine and valine. These
  amino acids occur in characteristic short (3-9 amino acids) tandem repeats, with
  a flexible and highly dynamic structure (Floquet et al. 2004). Unlike collagen,
  glycine in elastin is not rigorously positioned every 3 residues. However, glycine
  is distributed frequently throughout all hydrophobic domains of elastin, and displays
  a strong preference for inter-glycine spacing of 0-3 residues (Rauscher et al. 2006).
  <br><br>Elastic fibre formation involves the deposition of tropoelastin onto a template
  of fibrillin rich microfibrils. Recent results suggest that the first step of elastic
  fiber formation is the organization of small globules of elastin on the cell surface
  followed by globule aggregation into microfibres (Kozel et al. 2006). An important
  contribution to the initial stages assembly is thought to be made by the intrinsic
  ability of the protein to direct its own polymeric organization in a process termed
  'coacervation' (Bressan et al. 1986). This self-assembly process appears to be determined
  by interactions between hydrophobic domains (Bressan et al. 1986, Vrhovski et al.
  1997,  Bellingham et al. 2003, Cirulis & Keeley 2010) which result in alignment
  of the cross-linking domains, allowing the stabilization of elastin through the
  formation of cross-links generated through the oxidative deamination of lysine residues,
  catalyzed by members of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family (Reiser et al. 1992, Mithieux
  & Weiss 2005). The first step in the cross-linking reaction is the oxidative formation
  of the delta aldehyde, known as alpha aminoadipic semialdehyde or allysine (Partridge
  1963). Subsequent reactions that are probably spontaneous lead to the formation
  of cross-links through dehydrolysinonorleucine and allysine aldol, a trifunctional
  cross-link dehydromerodesmosine and two tetrafunctional cross-links desmosine and
  isodesmosine (Lucero & Kagan 2006), which are unique to elastin. These cross-links
  confer mechanical integrity and high durability. In addition to their role in self-assembly,
  hydrophobic domains provide elastin with its elastomeric properties, with initial
  studies suggesting that the elastomeric propereties of elastin are driven through
  changes in entropic interactions with surrounding water molecules (Hoeve & Flory
  1974). <br><br>A very specific set of proteases, broadly grouped under the name
  elastases, is responsible for elastin remodelling (Antonicelli et al. 2007). The
  matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are particularly important in elastin breakdown,
  with MMP2, 3, 9 and 12 explicitly shown to degrade elastin (Ra & Parks 2007). Nonetheless,
  elastin typically displays a low turnover rate under normal conditions over a lifetime
  (Davis 1993).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1566948
