description: Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into
  pyruvate, CH3COCOOâˆ’ + H+. The free energy released in this process is used to
  form the ATP and NADH. Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway that results in the
  generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as pyruvate,
  lactate, glycerol, glucogenic amino acids, and fatty acids. Description adapted
  from [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia].
