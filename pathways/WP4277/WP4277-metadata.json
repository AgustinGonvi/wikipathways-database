  "description": "Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOO\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 + H+. The free energy released in this process is used to form the ATP and NADH. Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates such as pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glucogenic amino acids, and fatty acids.
