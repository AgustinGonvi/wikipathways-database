  "description": "NGF stimulation induces expression of a wide array of transcriptional targets. In rat PC12 cells, a common model for NGF signaling, stimulation with NGF causes cells to exit the cell cycle and undergo a differentiation program leading to neurite outgrowth. This program is driven by the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), which frequently encode transcription factors regulating the activity of NGF-specific delayed response genes (reviewed in Sheng and Greenberg, 1990; Flavell and Grennberg, 2008; Santiago and Bashaw, 2014).
