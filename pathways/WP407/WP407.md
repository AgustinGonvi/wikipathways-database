description: 'Kit is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase, which is a receptor for stem
  cell factor or kit ligand. Signaling through Kit is important for formation of red
  cells, lymphocytes, mast cells and platelets among others. Binding of Kit receptor
  to stem cell factor leads to an intracellular cascade of events that includes activation
  of PI 3-kinase, Src family kinases and PLC gamma. Activating mutations in the Kit
  receptor are associated with several human malignancies include leukemias, gastrointestinal
  stromal tumors and mastocytomas.  Source: NetPath http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_6'
