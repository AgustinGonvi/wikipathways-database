description: As described in Hwang, et al., "The interaction of folate and alcohol
  consumption has been shown to have an antagonistic effect on the risk of oral cancer.
  Studies have demonstrated that increased intake of folate decreases the risk of
  oral cancer, while greater alcohol consumption has an opposite effect." This pathway
  is a hypothetical model for a causal role for P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase
  1 (ALDH1) in oral cancers, implicating folate (via SAM) and alcohol.
