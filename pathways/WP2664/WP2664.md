description: Gastrin is a hormone whose main function is to stimulate secretion of
  hydrochloric acid by the gastric mucosa, which results in gastrin formation inhibition.
  This hormone also acts as a mitogenic factor for gastrointestinal epithelial cells.
  Gastrin has two biologically active peptide forms, G34 and G17.Gastrin gene expression
  is upregulated in both a number of pre-malignant conditions and in established cancer
  through a variety of mechanisms. Depending on the tissue where it is expressed and
  the level of expression, differential processing of the polypeptide product leads
  to the production of different biologically active peptides. In turn, acting through
  the classical gastrin cholecystokinin B receptor CCK-BR, its isoforms and alternative
  receptors, these peptides trigger signalling pathways which influence the expression
  of downstream genes that affect cell survival, angiogenesis and invasion (Wank 1995,
  de Weerth et al. 1999, Grabowska & Watson 2007)  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=881907
