description: 'The urea cycle yields urea, the major form in which excess nitrogen
  is excreted from the human body, and the amino acid arginine (Brusilow and Horwich
  2001). It consists of four reactions: that of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate
  to form citrulline, of citrulline and aspartate to form argininosuccinate, the cleavage
  of argininosuccinate to yield fumarate and arginine, and the cleavage of arginine
  to yield urea and re-form ornithine. The carbamoyl phosphate consumed in this cycle
  is synthesized in the mitochondria from bicarbonate and ammonia, and this synthesis
  in turn is dependent on the presence of N-acetylglutamate, which allosterically
  activates carbamoyl synthetase I enzyme. The synthesis of N-acetylglutamate is stimulated
  by high levels of arginine. Increased levels of free amino acids, indicated by elevated
  arginine levels, thus stimulate urea synthesis.<p>Two enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis
  of arginine to yield ornithine and urea. Cytosolic ARG1 is the canonical urea cycle
  enzyme. Mitochondrial ARG2 likewise catalyzes urea production from arginine and
  may have a substantial sparing effect in patients lacking ARG1 enzyme, so its reaction
  is annotated here although the role of ARG2 under normal physiological conditions
  remains unclear.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=70635
