description: This pathway illustrates molecular interactions involved in the fundamental
  adaptive immune response for allograft destruction. This pathway was adapted in
  large part from [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05330.html KEGG]. In the
  initial step of this diagram, antigen presenting cells (APC's), either those from
  the donor (direct pathway) or from the recipient (indirect pathway) activate naive
  t cells leading to both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell maturation. CD8+ stimulated T cells
  lead to apoptosis of the allograft donor cells whereas CD4+ T cells differentiate
  into TH1, TH2, T17, and Treg cells. Activated TH1 produces TNFA and NO and damages
  donor graft cells by cytotoxicity. TH2 cell activates B cells. Activated B cells
  lead to plasma cell formation followed by IgG antibodies and the complement cascade
  pathway in acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and chronic AMR with C3 being
  the therapeutic target. Exogenous treatment with YCF inhibits C3, thus preventing
  AMR. Eculizumab binds to C5 which prevent C5a production and the membrane attack
  complex.  C3a and C35 act as potent chemotactic factors, promoting the infiltration
  of pro-inflammatory cells. Belatacept inhibits CD80/86 binding to CD28. Corticosteroids
  inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids contribute to immune suppression
  such as CTLA4 which inhibits T-cell activation.   Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2328
