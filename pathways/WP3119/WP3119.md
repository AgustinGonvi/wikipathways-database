description: This is the first pathway out of two pathways which deals with DNA damage
  response. It has two central gene products (ATM and ATR) which are connected to
  the sources of DNA damage (in blue). The two central genes can be divides furthermore
  into their most important genes. In the ATM pathway are the most important genes
  TP53 and CHEK2 and on the other hand in the ATR pathway is this CHEK1.  If it is
  not mentioned different, the processes take place in the cell cytoplasm. The goal
  of this first pathway is to give an overview of the most important gene products,
  processes and changes in the cell condition through the DNA damage response pathway
  and at the same time to keep it clearly arranged
