    "description": "This is an overview of the Hippo-Yap signaling pathway. YAP and TAZ are phosphorylated and held in cytoplasm when the Hippo-YAP pathway is at the \"ON\" status. Unphosphorylated YAP and TAZ accumulate in the nucleus with TEAD when the Hippo-Yap pathway is at the \"OFF\" status.",
