  "description": "The class C G-protein-coupled receptors are a class of G-protein coupled receptors that include the metabotropic glutamate receptors and several additional receptors (Brauner-Osborne H et al, 2007). Family C GPCRs have a large extracellular N-terminus which binds the orthosteric (endogenous) ligand. The shape of this domain is often likened to a clam. Several allosteric ligands to these receptors have been identified and these bind within the seven transmembrane region.
