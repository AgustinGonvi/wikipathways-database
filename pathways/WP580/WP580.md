description: 'From wormbook: In response to harsh environmental conditions, C. elegans
  larvae undergo dauer arrest at the second molt. The past decade has yielded many
  insights into the signaling pathways and the molecular mechanisms that govern this
  developmental transition. Dauer pheromone, the major physiologic signal promoting
  dauer arrest, has been purified, identified, and synthesized. The molecular identities
  of the vast majority of dauer regulatory genes isolated in initial genetic screens
  are now known. Physiologic ligands for DAF-12, a nuclear receptor that is the final
  common target of dauer regulatory pathways, have been identified. The discovery
  of the Hid (high temperature induction of dauer) phenotype and the results of enhancer
  screens have greatly expanded the repertoire of dauer regulatory genes. Genomic
  analysis of dauer arrest has highlighted the role of pathway crosstalk in dauer
  regulation. Nonetheless, critical questions remain about the mechanistic underpinnings
  of dauer arrest.'
