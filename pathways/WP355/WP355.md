description: 'The interleukin 1 family of cytokines includes interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A),
  beta (IL1B) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN). These bind to the IL-1 receptor
  (IL1R1) as well as its decoy receptor, IL1R2. Upon binding to the ligands, interleukin-1
  alpha or beta, IL1R1 interacts with IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) to
  activate the MAPK/JNK signaling modules. The MAPK pathway leads to activation of
  NFkB complex. As both IL-1 and TNF alpha stimulate the MAPK signaling module and
  activate NFkB, they are synergistic and complement each other''s activity.  Source:
