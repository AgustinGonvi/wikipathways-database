description: 'Caloric restriction leads to a decrease in the ATP/AMP ratio, thereby
  activating the key nutrient sensor of the body: AMPK.  AMPK then blocks mTOR function,
  as mTOR has an important role in regulating the balance between cell growth and
  autophagy, nutrient decrease leads to the induction of autophagy.  AMPK stimulates
  NAMPT function and PGC-1a release. NAMPT converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide
  for NAD+ synthesis. PGC-1a is the regulator of mitochondrial biosynthesis (increasing
  mitochondrial cell mass to produce more ATP) which thus will increase if more PGC-1a
  is released. Levels of NAD rise during caloric restriction leading to increased
  SIRT1 activity. SIRT1 blocks the Insulin/IGF-1 pathway. This is a very complex and
  paradoxal tissue, which need further investigation/research. Increased SIRT1 activity
  leads to activation of FOXO/p53 genes. FOXOs become phosphorylated by AKT and this
  may attenuate apoptotic stimuli and reduce antioxidative stress expression. In the
  end these effects result in increased stress resistance and improved lifespan and
  health span.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4191
