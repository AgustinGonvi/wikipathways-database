description: The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a virus in the Hepadnaviridae family which
  infects hepatocytes in the liver. It causes both acute and chronic infections, and
  prolonged chronic infection can lead to complications such as cirrhosis and an increased
  risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  The left side of the pathway describes
  the pathogenesis of HBV. The virus binds NTCP (SLC10A1) and is subsequently endocytosed.
  It is transported to the nucleus where viral polymerase creates covalently closed
  circular DNA (cccDNA). Using the host RNA polymerase, this is transcribed into viral
  mRNAs. Viral DNA polymerase then synthesizes viral DNA via its reverse transcriptase
  activity. Assembled viral particles exit the cell via the ESCRT pathway.  The HBV
  regulatory protein HBx interferes with many cellular processes including transcription,
  signal transduction, cell cycle progress, protein degradation, apoptosis and chromosomal
  stability.
