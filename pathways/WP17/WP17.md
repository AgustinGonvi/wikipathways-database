description: Insulin receptor pathway in C. elegans Initial version based on review
  by [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16441841 Gami and Wolkow] of pathways that
  affect ageing.  The DAF-2 gene encodes for the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
  receptor in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans with a diet of low glucose,
  reduced Daf-16 activity and worms lifespan was shortened compared to worms fed on
  media without glucose.
