Description: A simple model of the Fgf and Wnt gene network in the zebrafish tailbud.  Fgf signaling inhibits transcription of the Wnt inhibitors dkk1 and notum1a. PI3k signaling activates the Wnt pathway by phosphorylating (inactivating) Gsk3�. Phosphorylation of Gsk3� also leads to an increase in active Erk levels, suggesting Wnt signaling promotes Mapk activity. Fgf and Wnt have opposing effects on transcription of co-regulated genes, which include Fgf (spred3) and Wnt (dkk1, notum1a) inhibitors. (From Stulberg et al)
