description: 'The citrate cycle (TCA cycle, Krebs cycle) is an important aerobic pathway
  for the final steps of the oxidation of carbohydrates and fatty acids. The cycle
  starts with acetyl-CoA, the activated form of acetate, derived from glycolysis and
  pyruvate oxidation for carbohydrates and from beta oxidation of fatty acids. The
  two-carbon acetyl group in acetyl-CoA is transferred to the four-carbon compound
  of oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon compound of citrate. In a series of reactions
  two carbons in citrate are oxidized to CO2 and the reaction pathway supplies NADH
  for use in the oxidative phosphorylation and other metabolic processes. The pathway
  also supplies important precursor metabolites including 2-oxoglutarate. At the end
  of the cycle the remaining four-carbon part is transformed back to oxaloacetate.
  According to the genome sequence data, many organisms seem to lack genes for the
  full cycle [MD:M00009], but contain genes for specific segments [MD:M00010 M00011].  Source:
