description: 'The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4 (nuclear receptor subfamily
  3, group C, member 4), is a type of nuclear receptor that is activated by binding
  either of the androgenic hormones, testosterone, or dihydrotestosterone in the cytoplasm
  and then translocating into the nucleus. The main function of the androgen receptor
  is as a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates gene expression. The AR
  is important for therapeutic target in prostate cancer, thus many different inhibitors
  have been developed, primarily targeting the ligand binding domain of the protein,
  while inhibitors that target the N-terminal domain of the protein are still under
  development. Description source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_receptor
