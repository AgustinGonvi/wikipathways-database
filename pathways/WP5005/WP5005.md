description: Wnt-5a (WNT5) is known for being a highly specific regulated gene in
  response to microbial infection (Blumenthal et al. 2006, Pereira et al. 2008 & Ljungberg
  et al. 2019) including leishmaniasis (Chakraborty et al. 2017), where it seems to
  be involve in mechanisms that dampen the parasite load within main host macrophages
  (Chakraborty et al. 2017). In addition, WNT5 is a highly responsive gene in human
  macrophages present in chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Sen et al.
  2000), cancer (Pukrop et al. 2006), atherosclerosis (Christman et al. 2008) and
  obesity (Ouchi et al. 2010 & Ljungberg et al. 2019).<br><br>Frizzled-7 (FZD7) acts
  as a receptor of WNT5 which, upon binding, is implicated in the initiation of the
  non-canonical WNT pathway that ends up in the re-accommodation of the cytoskeleton
  to allow a process called planar cell polarity (PCP) (Ljungberg et al. 2019). The
  activation of the WNT5:FZD7 non-canonical signalling cascade that drives PCP is
  being studied for its involvement in inflammatory responses (Shao et al. 2016).
  Treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages with recombinant Wnt5a induced NADPH oxidase-mediated
  ROS production, which has been suggested to contribute to the macrophage control
  of L. donovani. Consequently, detailed understanding of how WNT signaling network
  defines host responses to infection could be important to identify potential targets
  (Ljungberg et al. 2019).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9673324
