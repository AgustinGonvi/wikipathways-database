description: 'In the absence of the Hh ligand, the receptor PTCH (Patched) acts to
  prevent high expression and activity of SMO (Smoothened). When Hh is bound, the
  repression of SMO is relieved which leads to activation of the GLI transcription
  factors: activators Gli1 and Gli2 and repressor Gli3. Activated GLI then controls
  the transcription of hedgehog target genes.  Pathway adapted from [http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa04340
