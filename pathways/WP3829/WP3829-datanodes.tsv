rRNA modification in
the mitochondrion	Pathway	R-HSA-6793080	Reactome	Five modified nucleotides have been detected in the 12S rRNA: 5-methylcytidine-841 catalyzed by NSUN4, 6-dimethyladenosine-936 catalyzed by TFB1M, 6-dimethyladenosine-937 catalyzed by TFB1M,  5-methyluridine-429, and 4-methylcytidine-839 (reviewed in Van Haute et al. 2015). Four modified nucleotides have been detected in 16S rRNA: 2'-O-methylguanosine-1145 catalyzed by MRM1, 2'-O-methylguanosine-1370 catalyzed by RNMTL1 (MRM3), 2'-O-methyluridine-1369 catalyzed by FTSJ2 (MRM2), and pseudouridine-1397. 2'-O-methyluridine-1369 and 2'-O-methylguanosone-1370 occur in the A-loop of rRNA which is located at the peptidyl transferase center of the large subunit. Here the modified residues play a role in interaction with the aminoacyl site of tRNA. Knockouts of TFB1M and NSUN4 are lethal in mice and mutations in TFB1M may be related to aminoglycoside-induced deafness (reviewed in Van Haute et al. 2015).

rRNA processing in
the nucleus and
cytosol	Pathway	R-HSA-8868773	Reactome	Each eukaryotic cytosolic ribosome contains 4 molecules of RNA: 28S rRNA (25S rRNA in yeast), 5.8S rRNA, and 5S rRNA in the 60S subunit and 18S rRNA in the 40S subunit. The 18S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and 28S rRNA are produced by endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic processing of a single 47S precursor (pre-rRNA) (reviewed in Henras et al. 2015). Transcription of ribosomal RNA genes, processing of pre-rRNA, modification of nucleotide residues within the rRNA, and assembly of precursor 60S and 40S subunits occur predominantly in the nucleolus (reviewed in Hernandez-Verdun et al. 2010, Boschi-Muller and Motorin 2013), with a few late reactions occurring in the cytosol.
