Description: Hippo signaling and the activation of YAP1/TAZ transcription is regulated by many other pathways (green labels) and factors. For example, the activation of SMAD and Beta catenin/TCF/LEF via TGF-beta signaling and WNT signaling pathways, respectively, enhanced the transcription of YAP1/TAZ target genes. This enhanced activity induces more aggressive  phenotypes of malignant mesothelioma cells such as cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelialï¿½mesenchymal transition (EMT).
