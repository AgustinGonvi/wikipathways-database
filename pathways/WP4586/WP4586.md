description: Metabolism of alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid to their respective
  acids. Both of these processes are catalyzed primarily by FADS1 and FADS2. The conversion
  of arachidonic acid to prostanoids is catalysed by prostaglandin G/H synthase 2
  and the conversion of arachidonic acid to lipoxins is catalysed by different types
  of lipoxygenases.
