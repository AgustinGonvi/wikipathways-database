description: 'Beta-oxidation begins once fatty acids have been imported into the mitochondrial
  matrix by carnitine acyltransferases. The beta-oxidation spiral of fatty acids metabolism
  involves the repetitive removal of two carbon units from the fatty acyl chain. There
  are four steps to this process: oxidation, hydration, a second oxidation, and finally
  thiolysis. The last step releases the two-carbon acetyl-CoA and a ready primed acyl-CoA
  that takes another turn down the spiral. In total each turn of the beta-oxidation
  spiral produces one NADH, one FADH2, and one acetyl-CoA.<p>Further oxidation of
  acetyl-CoA via the tricarboxylic acid cycle generates additional FADH2 and NADH.
  All reduced cofactors are used by the mitochondrial electron transport chain to
  form ATP. The complete oxidation of a fatty acid molecule produces numerous ATP
  molecules. Palmitate, used as the model here, produces 129 ATPs.<p>Beta-oxidation
  pathways differ for saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The beta-oxidation of
  saturated fatty acids requires four different enzymatic steps. Beta-oxidation produces
  and consumes intermediates with a trans configuration; unsaturated fatty acids that
  have bonds in the cis configuration require three separate enzymatic steps to prepare
  these molecules for the beta-oxidation pathway.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=77289
