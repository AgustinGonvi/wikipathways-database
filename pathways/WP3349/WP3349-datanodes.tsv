Respiratory electron
transport, ATP
synthesis by
chemiosmotic
coupling, and heat
production by
uncoupling
proteins.	Pathway	R-HSA-163200	Reactome	Oxidation of fatty acids and pyruvate in the mitochondrial matrix yield large amounts of NADH. The respiratory electron transport chain couples the re-oxidation of this NADH to NAD+ to the export of protons from the mitochonrial matrix, generating a chemiosmotic gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gradient is used to drive the synthesis of ATP; it can also be bypassed by uncoupling proteins to generate heat, a reaction in brown fat that may be important in regulation of body temperature in newborn children.

PIP3 activates AKT
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-1257604	Reactome	Signaling by AKT is one of the key outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. AKT is activated by the cellular second messenger PIP3, a phospholipid that is generated by PI3K. In ustimulated cells, PI3K class IA enzymes reside in the cytosol as inactive heterodimers composed of p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1). Phosphorylation of both the threonine and the serine residue is required to fully activate AKT. The active AKT then dissociates from PIP3 and phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins that play important roles in cell survival and metabolism. For a recent review of AKT signaling, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007.

Energy dependent
regulation of mTOR
by LKB1-AMPK	Pathway	R-HSA-380972	Reactome	Upon formation of a trimeric LKB1:STRAD:MO25 complex, LKB1 phosphorylates and activates AMPK. This phosphorylation is immediately removed in basal conditions by PP2C, but if the cellular AMP:ATP ratio rises, this activation is maintained, as AMP binding by AMPK inhibits the dephosphorylation. AMPK then activates the TSC complex by phosphorylating TSC2. Active TSC activates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb, resulting in GDP-loaded Rheb and inhibition of mTOR pathway.

Detoxification of
Reactive Oxygen
Species	Pathway	R-HSA-3299685	Reactome	Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide (O2.-), peroxides (ROOR), singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and hydroxyl radical (OH.) are generated by cellular processes such as respiration (reviewed in Murphy 2009, Brand 2010) and redox enzymes and are required for signaling yet they are damaging due to their high reactivity (reviewed in Imlay 2008, Buettner 2011, Kavdia 2011, Birben et al. 2012, Ray et al. 2012). Aerobic cells have defenses that detoxify reactive oxygen species by converting them to less reactive products. Superoxide dismutases convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (reviewed in Fukai and Ushio-Fukai 2011). Catalase and peroxidases then convert hydrogen peroxide to water.<br>Humans contain 3 superoxide dismutases: SOD1 is located in the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane space, SOD2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, and SOD3 is located in the extracellular region. Superoxide, a negative ion, is unable to easily cross membranes and tends to remain in the compartment where it was produced. Hydrogen peroxide, one of the products of superoxide dismutase, is able to diffuse across membranes and pass through aquaporin channels. In most cells the primary source of hydrogen peroxide is mitochondria and, once in the cytosol, hydrogen peroxide serves as a signaling molecule to regulate redox-sensitive proteins such as transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, and others (reviewed in Veal and Day 2011, Ray et al. 2012). Hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to water by catalase, decomposed to water plus oxidized thioredoxin by peroxiredoxins, and decomposed to water plus oxidized glutathione by glutathione peroxidases (Presnell et al. 2013).

Metabolism of amino
acids and
derivatives	Pathway	R-HSA-71291	Reactome	Cellular metabolism of amino acids and related molecules includes the pathways for the catabolism of amino acids, the biosynthesis of the nonessential amino acids (alanine, arginine, aspartate, asparagine, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, and serine) and selenocysteine, the synthesis of urea, and the metabolism of carnitine, creatine, choline, polyamides, melanin, and amine-derived hormones. The metabolism of amino acids provides a balanced supply of amino acids for protein synthesis. In the fasting state, the catabolism of amino acids derived from breakdown of skeletal muscle protein and other sources is coupled to the processes of gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis to meet the bodyâ€™s energy needs in the absence of dietary energy sources. These metabolic processes also provide the nitrogen atoms for the biosynthesis of nucleotides and heme, annotated as separate metabolic processes (Felig 1975; HÃ¤ussinger 1990; Owen et al. 1979).<p>Transport of these molecuels across lipid bilayer membranes is annotated separately as part of the module on "transmembrane transport of small molecules".

Metabolism of
nucleotides	Pathway	R-HSA-15869	Reactome	Nucleotides and their derivatives are used for short-term energy storage (ATP, GTP), for intra- and extra-cellular signaling (cAMP; adenosine), as enzyme cofactors (NAD, FAD), and for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Most dietary nucleotides are consumed by gut flora; the human body's own supply of these molecules is synthesized de novo. Additional metabolic pathways allow the interconversion of nucleotides, the salvage and reutilization of nucleotides released by degradation of DNA and RNA, the catabolism of excess nucleotides, and the transport of these molecules between the cytosol and the nucleus (Rudolph 1994). These pathways are regulated to control the total size of the intracellular nucleotide pool, to balance the relative amounts of individual nucleotides, and to couple the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides to the onset of DNA replication (S phase of the cell cycle).<P>These pathways are also of major clinical interest as they are the means by which nucleotide analogues used as anti-viral and anti-tumor drugs are taken up by cells, activated, and catabolized (Weilin and Nordlund 2010). As well, differences in nucleotide metabolic pathways between humans and aplicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium have been exploited to design drugs to attack the latter (Hyde 2007).<p>The movement of nucleotides and purine and pyrimidine bases across lipid bilayer membranes, mediated by SLC transporters, is annotated as part of the module "transmembrane transport of small molecules".
Metabolism of
carbohydrates	Pathway	R-HSA-71387	Reactome	Starches and sugars are major constituents of the human diet and the catabolism of monosaccharides, notably glucose, derived from them is an essential part of human energy metabolism (Dashty 2013). Glucose can be catabolized to pyruvate (glycolysis) and pyruvate synthesized from diverse sources can be metabolized to form glucose (gluconeogenesis). Glucose can be polymerized to form glycogen under conditions of glucose excess (glycogen synthesis), and glycogen can be broken down to glucose in response to stress or starvation (glycogenolysis). Other monosaccharides prominent in the diet, fructose and galactose, can be converted to glucose. The disaccharide lactose, the major carbohydrate in breast milk, is synthesized in the lactating mammary gland. The pentose phosphate pathway allows the synthesis of diverse monosaccharides from glucose including the pentose ribose-5-phosphate and the regulatory molecule xylulose-5-phosphate, as well as the generation of reducing equivalents for biosynthetic processes. Glycosaminoglycan metabolism and xylulose-5-phosphate synthesis from glucuronate are also annotated as parts of carbohydrate metabolism.<p>The digestion of dietary starch and sugars and the uptake of the resulting monosaccharides into the circulation from the small intestine are annotated as parts of the â€œDigestion and absorptionâ€� pathway.
