description: 'Pyrimidines are nucleic acids and the products of pyrimidine degradation
  are water-soluble. The pyrimidine ring is synthesized before it is conjugated to
  PRPP. The first reaction is the conjugation of carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate
  to make N-carbamoylaspartate. The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase used in pyrimidine
  biosynthesis is located in the cytoplasm. The enzyme that carries out the reaction
  is aspartate transcarbamoylase, an enzyme that is closely regulated. The second
  reaction is ring closure to form dihydroorotic acid by the enzyme dihydroorotase.
  This circular product contains a 6-membered ring with nitrogen and carbons located
  in the same positions as in the mature pyrimidine ring. The third reaction is the
  oxidation of the ring to form a carbon- carbon bond. The reducing equivalents are
  transferred to a flavin cofactor of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The
  product is orotic acid. Fourth, the orotate ring is transferred to phosphoribosyl
  pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form a 5-ribose-phosphate, orotidylic acid. Finally orotidylate
  is decarboxylated to yield UMP, which of course contains one of the bases of RNA.
  Cellular kinases convert UMP to UTP. Transfer of an amido nitrogen from glutamine
  by CTP synthetase converts UTP to CTP; this reaction uses an ATP high-energy phosphate.
  Pyrimidine synthesis is controlled at the first committed step. ATP stimulates the
  aspartate transcarbamoylase reaction, while CTP inhibits it. CTP is a feedback inhibitor
  of the pathway, and ATP is a feed-forward activator. This regulation ensures that
  a balanced supply of purines and pyrimidines exists for RNA and synthesis. Eukaryotic
  organisms contain a multifunctional enzyme with carbamoylphosphate synthetase, aspartate
  transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase activities. Two mechanisms control this enzyme.
  First, control at the level of enzyme synthesis exists; the transcription of the
  gene for the enzyme is reduced if an excess of pyrimidines is present. Secondly,
  control exists at the level of feedback inhibition by pyrimidine nucleotides. This
  enzyme is also an example of the phenomenon of metabolic channeling: aspartate,
  ammonia, and carbon dioxide enter the enzyme and come out as orotic acid  Description
