description: Involvement of cellular miRNAs in the signaling pathway of the immune
  response in sepsis. Cellular immune miRNAs target important components of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway at different levels regulating the inflammatory response in the
  pathogenesis of sepsis. Lower part of the figure illustrates the pathophysiological
  events in sepsis that lead to tissue injury and subsequent multiple organs failure.
