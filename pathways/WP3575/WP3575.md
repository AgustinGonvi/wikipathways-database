description: Many plasma membrane proteins are in a constant flux throughout the internal
  trafficking pathways of the cell. Some receptors are continuously internalized into
  recycling endosomes and returned to the cell surface. Others are sorted into intralumenal
  vesicles of morphologically distinctive endosomes that are known as multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs). These MVBs fuse with lysosomes, resulting in degradation of their
  cargo by lysosomal acidic hydrolases.<br>  Endosomes can be operationally defined
  as being either early or late, referring to the relative time it takes for endocytosed
  material to reach either stage. Ultrastructural studies indicate that early endosomes
  are predominantly tubulovesicular structures, which constitute a major sorting platform
  in the cell, whereas late endosomes show the characteristics of typical MVBs and
  are capable of fusing with lysosomes.<br>  A well characterized signal for shunting
  membrane proteins into the degradative MVB pathway is the ubiquitylation of these
  cargoes. At the center of a vast protein:protein and protein:lipid interaction network
  that underpins ubiquitin mediated sorting to the lysosome are the endosomal sorting
  complexes required for transport (ESCRTs), which are conserved throughout all major
  eukaryotic taxa.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=917729
