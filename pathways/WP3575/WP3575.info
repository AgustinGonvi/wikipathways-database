description: Many plasma membrane proteins are in a constant flux throughout the internal trafficking pathways of the cell. Some receptors are continuously internalized into recycling endosomes and returned to the cell surface. Others are sorted into intralumenal vesicles of morphologically distinctive endosomes that are known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These MVBs fuse with lysosomes, resulting in degradation of their cargo by lysosomal acidic hydrolases.<br>  Endosomes can be operationally defined as being either early or late, referring to the relative time it takes for endocytosed material to reach either stage. Ultrastructural studies indicate that early endosomes are predominantly tubulovesicular structures, which constitute a major sorting platform in the cell, whereas late endosomes show the characteristics of typical MVBs and are capable of fusing with lysosomes.<br>  A well characterized signal for shunting membrane proteins into the degradative MVB pathway is the ubiquitylation of these cargoes. At the center of a vast protein:protein and protein:lipid interaction network that underpins ubiquitin mediated sorting to the lysosome are the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs), which are conserved throughout all major eukaryotic taxa.
