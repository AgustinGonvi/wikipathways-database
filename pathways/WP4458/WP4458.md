description: 'Erythropoietin (EPO) is a cytokine that serves as the primary regulator
  of erythropoiesis, the differentiation of erythrocytes from stem cells in the liver
  of the fetus and the bone marrow of adult mammals (reviewed in Ingley 2012, Zhang
  et al. 2014, Kuhrt and Wojchowski 2015). EPO is produced in the kidneys in response
  to low oxygen tension and binds a receptor, EPOR, located on progenitor cells: burst
  forming unit-erythroid (BFU-e) cells and colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-e) cells.<br>The
  erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) exists in lipid rafts (reviewed in McGraw and List
  2017) as a dimer pre-associated with proteins involved in downstream signaling:
  the tyrosine kinase JAK2, the tyrosine kinase LYN, and the scaffold protein IRS2.
  Binding of EPO to the EPOR dimer causes a change in conformation (reviewed in Watowich
  et al. 2011, Corbett et al. 2016) that activates JAK2, which then transphosphorylates
  JAK2 and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of EPOR. The phosphorylated EPOR
  serves directly or indirectly as a docking site for signaling molecules such as
  STAT5, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C gamma
  (PLCG1, PLCG2), and activators of RAS (SHC1, GRB2:SOS1, GRB2:VAV1).<br>EPO activates
  4 major signaling pathways: STAT5-activated transcription, PI3K-AKT, RAS-RAF-ERK,
  and PLC-PKC. JAK2-STAT5 activates expression of BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) and therefore appears
  to be important for anti-apoptosis. PI3K-AKT appears to be important for both anti-apoptosis
  and proliferation. The roles of other signaling pathways are controversial but both
  RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PLCgamma-PKC have mitogenic effects. Phosphatases such as SHP1
  are also recruited and downregulate the EPO signal.<br>EPO also has effects outside
  of erythropoiesis. The EPOR is expressed in various tissues such as endothelium
  where it can act to stimulate growth and promote cell survival (Debeljak et al.
  2014, KimÃ¡kovÃ¡ et al. 2017). EPO and EPOR in the neurovascular system act via
  Akt, Wnt1, mTOR, SIRT1, and FOXO proteins to prevent apoptotic cell injury (reviewed
  in  Ostrowski and Heinrich 2018, Maiese 2016) and EPO may have therapeutic value
  in the nervous system (Ma et al. 2016).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9006335
