description: Action potentials occur in electrically excitable cells such as neurons,
  muscles, and endocrine cells. They are initiated by transient opening of voltage
  dependent sodium channels, causing a rapid, large depolarization of membrane potentials
  that spread along the axon membrane.<br>  The action potential travels down the
  axon and reaches the presynaptic terminal depolarizing the membrane in the pre synaptic
  terminal. The depolarization causes the voltage gated Ca2+ channels to open allowing
  the influx of Ca2+ that signals the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic
  cleft.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=112308
