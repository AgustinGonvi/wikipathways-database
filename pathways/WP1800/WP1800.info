description: Action potentials occur in electrically excitable cells such as neurons, muscles, and endocrine cells. They are initiated by transient opening of voltage dependent sodium channels, causing a rapid, large depolarization of membrane potentials that spread along the axon membrane.<br>  The action potential travels down the axon and reaches the presynaptic terminal depolarizing the membrane in the pre synaptic terminal. The depolarization causes the voltage gated Ca2+ channels to open allowing the influx of Ca2+ that signals the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft.
