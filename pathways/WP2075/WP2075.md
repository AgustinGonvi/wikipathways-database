description: 'This pathway displays current genes, proteolytic events and other processes
  associated with the progression of Alzheimer''s disease. This pathway was adapted
  from KEGG on 10/7/2011. Note: mitochondrial associated genes Cx I through Cx V are
  not currently included, as these correspond to over a hundred distinct factors.
  See below source URL for more information.'
