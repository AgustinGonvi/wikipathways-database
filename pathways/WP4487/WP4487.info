Description: This pathway visualises the mechanism of ophthalmate biosynthesis in hepatocytes. GSH can inhibits GCC; however when the cell is facing oxidative stress, GSH is consumed, and therefore activating GCS. This enhances the biosynthesis of ophthalmate, which is transported out of the cell over the hepatocellular membrane via MRP transporters.
