description: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenetic disorder caused by a mutation
  in the FMR1 gene and the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and
  autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Patients with FXS show a range of typical physical
  features such as macro-orchidism in males, a long and narrow face, large and protruding
  ears, and hyperextensible joints. Common comorbidities of FXS are neuropsychiatric
  disorders such as hyperactivity, depression and anxiety.  The mutation of FMR1 in
  FXS disrupts production of the FMR1 gene product, the fragile mental retardation
  protein (FMRP). The main function of FMRP is to locally act as a translational repressor
  for target mRNAs and thereby regulate de novo protein synthesis and ultimately synaptic
  plasticity. FMRP, together with the mTOR pathway and the ERK pathway regulates expression
  of target mRNAsn mediated by stimulation of Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors
  (mGluR) and thereby regulate  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
  receptor (AMPAR) internalisation and thus long term depression (LTD).  LTD is a
  form of synaptic plasticity which is involved in learning and memory. Lack of FMRP
  leads to exaggerated mGluR dependant LTD, which accounts for most of FXS pathogenesis.
