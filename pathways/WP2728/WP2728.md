description: 'Incretins are peptide hormones produced by the gut that enhance the
  ability of glucose to stimulate insulin secretion from beta cells in the pancreas.
  Two incretins have been identified: Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Glucose-dependent
  Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP, initially named Gastric Inhibitory Peptide). Both
  are released by cells of the small intestine, GLP-1 from L cells and GIP from K
  cells.<br>The control of incretin secretion is complex. Fatty acids, phospholipids,
  glucose, acetylcholine, leptin, and Gastrin-releasing Peptide all stimulate secretion
  of GLP-1. Fatty acids and phospholipids are the primary stimulants of secretion
  of GIP in humans (carbohydrates have more effect in rodents).<br>Incretins secreted
  into the bloodstream are subject to rapid inactivation by Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV
  (DPP IV), which confers half-lives of only a few minutes onto GLP-1 and GIP. Inhibitors
  of DPP IV, for example sitagliptin, are now being used in the treatment of Type
  2 diabetes.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=400508
