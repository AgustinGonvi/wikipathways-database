description: 'Galactose is converted into glucose 1-phosphate (G1P) through a series
  of steps called the Leloir pathway. The first step of the pathway is the phosphorylation
  of galactose by galactokinase (encoded GALK1) to yield galactose 1-phosphate. Conversion
  of galactose 1-phosphate to G1P requires the transfer of UDP from UDP-glucose catalyzed
  by GALT. UDP-galactose is converted to UDP-glucose by GALE. Glucose-1-phosphate
  is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and vice versa.
  There are two known disorders concerning the uptake transports of galactose (SGLT1
  and GLUT2 deficiency) and three known disorders of galactose metabolism: galactokinase
  deficiency (GALK-D), galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency (galactosemia,
  GALT-D) and uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase deficiency (GALE-D). Among
  these, galactosemia is the most common and most severe.'
