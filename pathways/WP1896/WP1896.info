description: A regulated balance between cell survival and apoptosis is essential for normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms  (see Matsuzawa, 2001).  Defects in control of this balance may contribute  to autoimmune disease, neurodegeneration and cancer.  Protein ubiquitination and degradation is one of the major mechanisms that regulate apoptotic cell death (reviewed in Yang and Yu 2003).
