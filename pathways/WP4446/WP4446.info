description: The known DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) can be SUMOylated (reviewed in Xu et al. 2010, Denis et al. 2011). SUMOylation affects the catalytic activity of DNMT1 and the protein interactions of DNMT3A.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=4655427 Reactome].
