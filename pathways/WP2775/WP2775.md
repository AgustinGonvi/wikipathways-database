description: In human, ten members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (TLR1-TLR10)
  have been identified (TLR11 has been found in mouse, but not in human). All TLRs
  have a similar Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain in their cytoplasmic region and an
  Ig-like domain in the extracellular region, where each is enriched with a varying
  number of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Each TLR can recognize specific microbial
  pathogen components. The binding pathogenic component to TLR initializes signaling
  pathways that lead to induction of Interferon alpha/beta and inflammatory cytokines.
  There are two main signaling pathways. The first is a MyD88-dependent pathway that
  is common to all TLRs, except TLR3; the second is a TRIF(TICAM1)-dependent pathway
  that is peculiar to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR4-mediated signaling pathway via TRIF requires
  adapter molecule TRAM (TRIF-related adapter molecule or TICAM2). TRAM is thought
  to bridge between the activated TLR4 complex and TRIF.(Takeda & Akira 2004; Akira
  2003; Takeda & Akira 2005; Kawai 2005; Heine & Ulmer 2005).  View original pathway
