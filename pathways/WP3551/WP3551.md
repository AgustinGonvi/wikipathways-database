description: The first line of defense against infectious agents involves an active
  recruitment of phagocytes to the site of infection. Recruited cells include polymorhonuclear
  (PMN) leukocytes (i.e., neutrophils) and monocytes/macrophages, which function together
  as innate immunity sentinels (Underhill DM & Ozinsky A 2002; Stuart LM & Ezekowitz
  RA 2005; Flannagan RS et al. 2012). Dendritic cells are also present, serving as
  important players in antigen presentation for ensuing adaptive responses (Savina
  A & Amigorena S 2007). These cell types are able to bind and engulf invading microbes
  into a membrane-enclosed vacuole - the phagosome, in a process termed phagocytosis.
  Phagocytosis can be defined as the receptor-mediated engulfment of particles greater
  than 0.5 micron in diameter. It is initiated by the cross-linking of host cell membrane
  receptors following engagement with their cognate ligands on the target surface
  (Underhill DM & Ozinsky A 2002; Stuart LM & Ezekowitz RA 2005; Flannagan RS et al.
  2012). When engulfed by phagocytes, microorganisms are exposed to a number of host
  defense microbicidal events within the resulting phagosome. These include the production
  of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, RONS) by specialized enzymes
  (Fang FC et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F
  et al. 2013). NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex consume oxygen to produce superoxide radical
  anion (O2.-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Robinson et al. 2004). Induced NO synthase
  (iNOS) is involved in the production of NO, which is the primary source of all RNS
  in biological systems (Evans TG et al. 1996). The phagocyte NADPH oxidase and iNOS
  are expressed in both PMN and mononuclear phagocytes and both cell types have the
  capacity for phagosomal burst activity. However, the magnitude of ROS generation
  in neutrophils far exceeds that observed in macrophages (VanderVen BC et al. 2009).
  Macrophages are thought to produce considerably more RNS than neutrophils (Fang
  FC et al. 2004; Nathan & Shiloh 2000).<p>The presence of RONS characterized by a
  relatively low reactivity, such as H2O2, O2Ë™âˆ’ or NO, has no deleterious effect
  on biological environment (Attia SM 2010; Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015). Their
  activity is controlled by endogenous antioxidants (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic)
  that are induced by oxidative stress. However the relatively low reactive species
  can initiate a cascade of reactions to generate more damaging â€œsecondaryâ€� species
  such as hydroxyl radical (â€¢OH), singlet oxygen or peroxinitrite (Robinson JM 2008;
  Fang FC et al. 2004). These "secondary" RONS are extremely toxic causing irreversible
  damage to all classes of biomolecules (Weidinger A & and Kozlov AV 2015; Fang FC
  et al. 2004; Kohchi C et al. 2009; Gostner JM et al. 2013; Vatansever F et al. 2013).<p>Although
  macrophages and neutrophils use similar mechanisms for the internalization of targets,
  there are differences in how they perform phagocytosis and in the final outcome
  of the process (Tapper H & Grinstein S 1997; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Once formed,
  the phagosome undergoes an extensive maturation process whereby it develops into
  a microbicidal organelle able to eliminate the invading pathogen. Maturation involves
  re-modeling both the membrane of the phagosome and its luminal contents (Vierira
  OV et al. 2002). In macrophages, phagosome formation and maturation follows a series
  of strictly coordinated membrane fission/fusion events between the phagosome and
  compartments of the endo/lysosomal network gradually transforming the nascent phagosome
  into a phagolysosome, a degradative organelle endowed with potent microbicidal properties
  (Zimmerli S et al. 1996; Vierira OV et al. 2002). Neutrophils instead contain a
  large number of preformed granules such as azurophilic and specific granules that
  can rapidly fuse with phagosomes delivering antimicrobial substances (Karlsson A
  & Dahlgren C 2002; Naucler C et al. 2002; Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011). Phagosomal
  pH dynamics may also contribute to the maturation process by regulating membrane
  traffic events. The microbicidal activity of macrophages is characterized by progressive
  acidification of the lumen (down to pH 4â€“5) by the proton pumping vATPase. A low
  pH is a prerequisite for optimal enzymatic activity of most late endosomal/lysosomal
  hydrolases reported in macrophages. Neutrophil phagosome pH regulation differs significantly
  from what is observed in macrophages (Nordenfelt P and Tapper H 2011; Winterbourn
  CC et al. 2016). The massive activation of the oxidative burst is thought to result
  in early alkalization of neutrophil phagosomes which is linked to proton consumption
  during the generation of hydrogen peroxide (Segal AW et al. 1981; Levine AP et al.
  2015). Other studies showed that neutrophil phagosome maintained neutral pH values
  before the pH gradually decreased (Jankowski A et al. 2002). Neutrophil phagosomes
  also exhibited a high proton leak, which was initiated upon activation of the NADPH
  oxidase, and this activation counteracted phagosomal acidification (Jankowski A
  et al. 2002).<p>The Reactome module describes ROS and RNS production by phagocytic
  cells. The module includes cell-type specific events, for example, myeloperoxidase
  (MPO)-mediated production of hypochlorous acid in neutrophils. It also highlights
  differences between phagosomal pH dynamics in neutrophils and macrophages. The module
  describes microbicidal activity of selective RONS such as hydroxyl radical or peroxynitrite.
  However, detection of any of these species in the phagosomal environment is subject
  to many uncertainties (NÃ¼sse O 2011; Erard M et al. 2018). The mechanisms by which
  reactive oxygen/nitrogen species kill pathogens in phagocytic immune cells are still
  not fully understood.   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1222556
