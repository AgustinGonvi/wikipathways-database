description: Advanced Glycosylation End- product-specific Receptor (AGER) also known
  as Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand membrane
  receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is considered to be a Pattern
  Recognition Receptor (Liliensiek et al. 2004). It recognizes a large variety of
  modified proteins known as advanced glycation/glycosylation endproducts (AGEs),
  a heterogenous group of structures that are generated by the Maillard reaction,
  a consequence of long-term incubation of proteins with glucose (Ikeda et al. 1996).
  Their accumulation is associated with diabetes, atherosclerosis, renal failure and
  ageing (Schmidt et al. 1999). The most prevalent class of AGE in vivo are N(6)-carboxymethyllysine
  (NECML) adducts (Kislinger et al. 1991). In addition to AGEs, AGER is a signal transduction
  receptor for amyloid-beta peptide (Ab) (Yan et al. 1996), mediating Ab neurotoxicity
  and promoting Ab influx into the brain. AGER also responds to the proinflammatory
  S100/calgranulins (Hofmann et al. 1999) and High mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1/Amphoterin/DEF),
  a protein linked to neurite outgrowth and cellular motility (Hori et al. 1995).<br><br>The
  major inflammatory pathway stimulated by AGER activation is NFkappaB. Though the
  signaling cascade is unclear, several pieces of experimental data suggest that activation
  of AGER leads to sustained activation and upregulation of NFkappaB, measured as
  NFkappaB translocation to the nucleus, and increased levels of de novo synthesized
  NFkappaB (Bierhaus et al. 2001). As this is clearly an indirect effect it is represented
  here as positive regulation of NFkappaB translocation to the nucleus. AGER can bind
  ERK1/2 and thereby activate the MAPK and JNK cascades (Bierhaus et al. 2005).  View
