description: '1q21.1 copy number variation (deletion or duplication) syndromes are
  known for a highly variable phenotype especially concerning psychiatric problems.
  The genes on the red DNA strand represents the deleted, or duplicated, region. The
  downstream effects and interaction partners of the different genes are shown according
  to available knowledge. The breakpoints (chr1:146,527,987-147,394,444, GRCh37/hg19)
  are defined as given in  Kendall et al. 2017: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.08.014.'
