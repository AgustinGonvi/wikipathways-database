description: Osteoblasts are specialized, terminally differentiated uninucleated cells
  responsible for bone formation. Their activity is tightly regulated by external
  stimuli, originating from e.g. the parathyroid glands, osteocytes, etc.   Along
  with osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone degradation, osteoblasts are key
  regulators of the shape and volume of bone tissue.
