description: Fructose is found in fruits, is one of the components of the disaccharide
  sucrose, and is a widely used sweetener in processed foods. Dietary fructose is
  catabolized in the liver via fructose 1-phosphate to yield dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which then are converted to pyruvate via steps of
  canonical glycolysis (Hers & Kusaka 1953; Sillero et al. 1969). Excessive dietary
  intake of fructose and its metabolism have been associated with major disease risks
  in humans, although this issue remains controversial (Kolderup & Svihus 2015; DiNicolantonio
  et al. 2015; Bray 2013; Mayes 1993; Rippe & Angelopoulos 2013; van Buul et al. 2013).
  Fructose can also be synthesized from glucose via the polyol pathway (Hers 1960;
  Oates 2008). This synthetic process provides the fructose found in seminal fluid
  and, in other tissues, can contribute to pathologies of diabetes.  View original
