description: Hedgehog is a secreted morphogen that has evolutionarily conserved roles
  in body organization by regulating the activity of the Ci/Gli transcription factor
  family. In Drosophila in the absence of Hh signaling, full-length Ci is partially
  degraded by the proteasome to generate a truncated repressor form that translocates
  to the nucleus to represses Hh-responsive genes. Binding of Hh ligand to the Patched
  (PTC) receptor allows the 7-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) to be activated
  in an unknown manner, disrupting the partial proteolysis of Ci and allowing the
  full length activator form to accumulate (reviewed in Ingham et al, 2011; Briscoe
  and Therond, 2013).  <br>While many of the core components of Hh signaling are conserved
  from flies to humans, the pathways do show points of significant divergence. Notably,
  the human genome encodes three Ci homologues, GLI1, 2 and 3 that each play slightly
  different roles in regulating Hh responsive genes. GLI3 is the primary repressor
  of Hh signaling in vertebrates, and is converted to the truncated GLI3R repressor
  form in the absence of Hh. GLI2 is a potent activator of transcription in the presence
  of Hh but contributes only minimally to the repression function. While a minor fraction
  of GLI2 protein is processed into the repressor form in the absence of Hh, the majority
  is either fully degraded by the proteasome or sequestered in the full-length form
  in the cytosol by protein-protein interactions. GLI1 lacks the repression domain
  and appears to be an obligate transcriptional activator (reviewed in Briscoe and
  Therond, 2013).<br> Vertebrate but not fly Hh signaling also depends on the movement
  of pathway components through the primary cilium. The primary cilium is a non-motile
  microtubule based structure whose construction and maintenance depends on intraflagellar
  transport (IFT). Anterograde IFT moves molecules from the ciliary base along the
  axoneme to the ciliary tip in a manner that requires the microtubule-plus-end directed
  kinesin KIF3 motor complex and the IFT-B protein complex, while retrograde IFT back
  to the ciliary base depends on the minus-end directed dynein motor and the IFT-A
  complex. Genetic screens have identified a number of cilia-related proteins that
  are required both to maintain Hh in the 'off' state and to transduce the signal
  when the pathway is activated (reviewed in Hui and Angers, 2011; Goetz and Anderson,
  2010).      View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5632684
