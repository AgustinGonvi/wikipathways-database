description: Electrical transmission across nerve cells is accomplished when the current
  generated in the upstream neuron spreads to the downstream neuron through a path
  of low electrical resistance. In neurons this is accomplished at gap junctions.
  Electrical synapses are found in neuronal tissue where the activity of neurons must
  be highly synchronized. The neurons responsible for hormone secretion from the mammalian
  hypothalamus are a class of highly synchronized electric neurons.  Gap junctions
  connecting the presynaptic cell with the postsynaptic cell allow current generated
  in the presynaptic cell to flow directly into the postsynaptic cell. Transmission
  speed is dramatically increased in such a system. The junction itself is composed
  of two hemichannels, one each on the pre- and postsysnaptic cells. These channels
  are composed of members of the connexin family of proteins.  View original pathway
