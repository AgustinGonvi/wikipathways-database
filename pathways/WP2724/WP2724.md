description: 'There are two major classes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs):
  the omega-3 (n-3) and the omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids, where the number corresponds
  to the position of the first double bond proximate to the methyl end of the fatty
  acid. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids. Humans
  cannot synthesize them, instead they are supplied through diet. Linoleic acid (LA,
  18:2(n-6)), a major component of omega-6 fatty acids and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA,
  18:2(n-3)) a major component of omega-3 fatty acids are the two main dietary essential
  fatty acids (EFAs) in humans. ALA and LA obtained from diet are converted in the
  body into their longer chain and more unsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 products by
  a series of desaturation and elongation steps. Metabolism of ALA and LA to their
  corresponding products is mediated via common enzyme systems. In humans ALA is finally
  converted to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6(n-3)), and LA is converted to docosapentaenoic
  acid (DPA, C22:5(n-6)). The intermediary omega-3 and omega-6 series fatty acids
  play a significant role in health and disease by generating potent modulatory molecules
  for inflammatory responses, including eicosanoids (prostaglandins, and leukotrienes),
  and cytokines (interleukins) and affecting the gene expression of various bioactive
  molecules (Kapoor & Huang 2006, Sprecher 2002, Burdge 2006).  View original pathway
