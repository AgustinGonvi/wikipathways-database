description: 'Wnt family of proteins are a large family of cysteine-rich secreted
  glycoproteins that regulate cell-cell interactions. They bind to members of the
  Frizzled family of 7 transmembrane receptors. Binding of Wnt to its receptors leads
  to activation of at least 3 distinct pathways: i) the canonical beta catenin pathway,
  ii) the planar cell polarity pathway, and, iii) the calcium pathway. In the canonical
  beta catenin pathway, binding of Wnt to its receptors leads to stabilization of
  beta catenin in the cytosol followed by its translocation into the nucleus where
  it activates the transcription factor Tcf/Lef leading to upregulation of target
  genes. The non canonical planar cell polarity pathway involves activation of Dishevelled,
  small G proteins (Rho/Rac) and JNK. The non canonical calcium pathway involves activation
  of calcium sensitive kinases, PKC and CAMKII by Dishevelled. The Wnt signaling pathway
  is similar to the Hedgehog pathway in many respects. Abnormalities in the Wnt signaling
  pathway are associated with a large variety of human malignancies including tumors
  of breast, colon, pancreas, liver and bone.  Source: [http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_8
