description: 'Microtubules (MTs) are essential for vesicle transport, cellular polarity
  and the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. MTs are dynamic, undergoing assembly
  and depolymerization (primarily at the "plus end") by processes actively regulated
  by signaling pathways. The tubulin dimers that constitute MTs (depicted in green)
  are bound and sequestered by stathmin (STMN), enhancing MT dynamics by increasing
  rapid depolymerization (a.k.a., "MT catastrophe"). MT dynamics are also enhanced
  by collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP2), which increases MT growth by promoting
  the addition of tubulin dimers onto microtubule plus ends. Other proteins that associate
  with assembled MTs include those that stabilize MTs (e.g. tau or MAPT), those that
  promote assembly (e.g., XMAP215), and those that maintain MTs in a dynamic state
  (e.g., MAP1B). Complexes between the adenomateous polyposis coli (APC) protein and
  plus end binding proteins (e.g., EB1) stabilize MTs by increasing the duration of
  the MT elongation phase. MT instability is promoted by several nonmotile kinesins
  from the kinesin-13 family, e.g., the mitotic centromere associated kinesin, MCAK,
  by accelerating the transition to catastrophe by weakening the lateral interactions
  between the protofilaments. Upstream from these processes, major signaling pathways
  act to regulate MT dynamics, e.g., those converging on GSK3B, a kinase which targets
  tau and CRMP2.   Reference: https://www.cellsignal.com/contents/science-pathway-research-cytoskeletal/regulation-of-microtubule-dynamics-signaling-pathway/pathways-micro  Proteins
