description: Development of white versus brown adipocytes (figure from Handbook of
  Obesity). Transcription factors and nuclear regulators controlling the development
  of white versus brown adipocytes are shown in the pathway.  At the bottom a selection
  of identified markers of white and brown adipocytes were added (from Nascimento
  et al).
