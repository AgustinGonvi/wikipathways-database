description: 'Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide (O2.-), peroxides (ROOR),
  singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and hydroxyl radical (OH.) are generated
  by cellular processes such as respiration (reviewed in Murphy 2009, Brand 2010)
  and redox enzymes and are required for signaling yet they are damaging due to their
  high reactivity (reviewed in Imlay 2008, Buettner 2011, Kavdia 2011, Birben et al.
  2012, Ray et al. 2012). Aerobic cells have defenses that detoxify reactive oxygen
  species by converting them to less reactive products. Superoxide dismutases convert
  superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (reviewed in Fukai and Ushio-Fukai 2011).
  Catalase and peroxidases then convert hydrogen peroxide to water.<br>Humans contain
  3 superoxide dismutases: SOD1 is located in the cytosol and mitochondrial intermembrane
  space, SOD2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, and SOD3 is located in the extracellular
  region. Superoxide, a negative ion, is unable to easily cross membranes and tends
  to remain in the compartment where it was produced. Hydrogen peroxide, one of the
  products of superoxide dismutase, is able to diffuse across membranes and pass through
  aquaporin channels. In most cells the primary source of hydrogen peroxide is mitochondria
  and, once in the cytosol, hydrogen peroxide serves as a signaling molecule to regulate
  redox-sensitive proteins such as transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, ion
  channels, and others (reviewed in Veal and Day 2011, Ray et al. 2012). Hydrogen
  peroxide is decomposed to water by catalase, decomposed to water plus oxidized thioredoxin
  by peroxiredoxins, and decomposed to water plus oxidized glutathione by glutathione
  peroxidases (Presnell et al. 2013).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=3299685
