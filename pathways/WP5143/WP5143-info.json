    "description": "Schematic representation of GDNF induced signaling reactions. The signaling pathway map represents molecules involved in ligand-receptor interactions and GDNF receptor activated downstream molecular events including molecular association, enzyme catalysis, translocation, and gene regulation events. In addition, information regarding the post-translational modification site and the residue is also shown in the pathway.",
