description: NTRK3 (TRKC) belongs to the family of neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinases, which also includes NTRK1 (TRKA) and NTRK2 (TRKB). Neurotrophin-3 (NTF3, also known as NT-3) is the ligand for NTRK3. Similar to other NTRK receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases in general, ligand binding induces receptor dimerization followed by trans-autophosphorylation on conserved tyrosines in the intracellular (cytoplasmic) domain of the receptor (Lamballe et al. 1991, Philo et al. 1994, Tsoulfas et al. 1996, Yuen and Mobley 1999, Werner et al. 2014). These conserved tyrosines serve as docking sites for adaptor proteins that trigger downstream signaling cascades. Signaling through PLCG1 (Marsh and Palfrey 1996, Yuen and Mobley 1999, Huang and Reichardt 2001), PI3K (Yuen and Mobley 1999, Tognon et al. 2001, Huang and Reichardt 2001, Morrison et al. 2002, Lannon et al. 2004, Jin et al. 2008) and RAS (Marsh and Palfrey 1996, Gunn-Moore et al. 1997, Yuen and Mobley 1999, Gromnitza et al. 2018), downstream of activated NTRK3, regulates cell survival, proliferation and motility.<p>In the absence of its ligand, NTRK3 functions as a dependence receptor and triggers BAX and CASP9-dependent cell death (Tauszig-Delamasure et al. 2007, Ichim et al. 2013).<p>NTRK3 was reported to activate STAT3 through JAK2, but the exact mechanism has not been elucidated (Kim et al. 2016). NTRK3 was reported to interact with the adaptor protein SH2B2, but the biological role of this interaction has not been determined (Qian et al. 1998).<p>Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRO and PTPRS (PTPsigma) negatively regulate NTRK3 signaling by dephosphorylating NTRK3 (Beltran et al. 2003, Faux et al. 2007, Hower et al. 2009, Tchetchelnitski et al. 2014). In addition to dephosphorylation of NTRK3 in-cis, the extracellular domain of pre-synaptic PTPRS can bind in-trans to extracellular domain of post-synaptic NTRK3, contributing to synapse formation (Takahashi et al. 2011, Coles et al. 2014).
