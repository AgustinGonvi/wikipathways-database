description: NTRK3 (TRKC) belongs to the family of neurotrophin receptor tyrosine
  kinases, which also includes NTRK1 (TRKA) and NTRK2 (TRKB). Neurotrophin-3 (NTF3,
  also known as NT-3) is the ligand for NTRK3. Similar to other NTRK receptors and
  receptor tyrosine kinases in general, ligand binding induces receptor dimerization
  followed by trans-autophosphorylation on conserved tyrosines in the intracellular
  (cytoplasmic) domain of the receptor (Lamballe et al. 1991, Philo et al. 1994, Tsoulfas
  et al. 1996, Yuen and Mobley 1999, Werner et al. 2014). These conserved tyrosines
  serve as docking sites for adaptor proteins that trigger downstream signaling cascades.
  Signaling through PLCG1 (Marsh and Palfrey 1996, Yuen and Mobley 1999, Huang and
  Reichardt 2001), PI3K (Yuen and Mobley 1999, Tognon et al. 2001, Huang and Reichardt
  2001, Morrison et al. 2002, Lannon et al. 2004, Jin et al. 2008) and RAS (Marsh
  and Palfrey 1996, Gunn-Moore et al. 1997, Yuen and Mobley 1999, Gromnitza et al.
  2018), downstream of activated NTRK3, regulates cell survival, proliferation and
  motility.<p>In the absence of its ligand, NTRK3 functions as a dependence receptor
  and triggers BAX and CASP9-dependent cell death (Tauszig-Delamasure et al. 2007,
  Ichim et al. 2013).<p>NTRK3 was reported to activate STAT3 through JAK2, but the
  exact mechanism has not been elucidated (Kim et al. 2016). NTRK3 was reported to
  interact with the adaptor protein SH2B2, but the biological role of this interaction
  has not been determined (Qian et al. 1998).<p>Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases
  PTPRO and PTPRS (PTPsigma) negatively regulate NTRK3 signaling by dephosphorylating
  NTRK3 (Beltran et al. 2003, Faux et al. 2007, Hower et al. 2009, Tchetchelnitski
  et al. 2014). In addition to dephosphorylation of NTRK3 in-cis, the extracellular
  domain of pre-synaptic PTPRS can bind in-trans to extracellular domain of post-synaptic
  NTRK3, contributing to synapse formation (Takahashi et al. 2011, Coles et al. 2014).  View
