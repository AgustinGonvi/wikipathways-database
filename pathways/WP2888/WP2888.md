description: One of the functions of the Wnt-signaling pathway in the nematode Caenorhabditis
  elegans (C. elegans) is to control the proper anterior-posterior axis migration
  of descendants of the QL and QR neuroblasts. In wild type animals, Wnt signaling
  is activated in the QL neuroblast to induce expression of the Hox gene mab-5 resulting
  in the appropriate posterior migration of QL descendants. Any disruption in the
  Wnt signaling pathway leading to mab-5 expression results in erroneous anterior
  migration of QL neuroblast descendants.
