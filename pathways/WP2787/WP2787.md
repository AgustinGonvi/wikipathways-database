description: Syndecans are type I transmembrane proteins, with an N-terminal ectodomain
  that contains several consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment
  and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Syndecan-1 and -3 GAG attachment sites
  occur in two distinct clusters, one near the N-terminus and the other near the membrane-attachment
  site, separated by a proline and threonine-rich 'spacer'. Syndecan ectodomain sequences
  are poorly conserved in the family and between species, but the transmembrane and
  cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved. Syndecan-1 and -3 form a subfamily. Syndecan
  core proteins form dimers (Choi et al. 2007) and at least syndecan-3 and -4 form
  oligomers (Asundi & Carey 1995, Shin et al. 2012).  Syndecan-1 is the major syndecan
  of epithelial cells including vascular endothelium. Syndecan-2 is present mostly
  in mesenchymal, neuronal and smooth muscle cells. Syndecan-3 is the major syndecan
  of the nervous system, while syndecan-4 is ubiquitously expressed but at lower levels
  than the other syndecans (refs in Alexopoulou et al. 2007). The core syndecan protein
  has three to five heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate chains, which interact
  with a variety of ligands including fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial
  growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, fibronectin, collagen, vitronectin
  and several integrins. Syndecans may act as integrin coreceptors. Interactions between
  fibronectin and syndecans are modulated by tenascin-C.   Syndecans bind a wide variety
  of soluble and insoluble ligands, inckluding extracellular matrix components, cell
  adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines, and proteinases. As the cleaved ectodomains
  of syndecans retain the ability to bind ligands, ectodomain shedding is a mechanism
  for releasing soluble effectors that may compete for ligands with their cell-bound
  counterparts (Kainulainen et al. 1998). Shed  ectodomains are found in inflammatory
  fluids (Subramanian et al. 1997) and may induce the proliferation of cancer cells
  (Maeda et al. 2004).   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=3000170
