description: The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway regulates and protects the
  cell from improperly folded protein overload in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).
  The UPR can result in the slowing of protein synthesis, which gives the cell time
  to translate more chaperones to help process the proteins. If the stress is too
  high, the UPR can eventually trigger apoptosis.
