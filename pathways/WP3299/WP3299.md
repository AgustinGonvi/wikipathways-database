description: Four transcription factors (OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and c-MYC) reprogram adult
  cells into stem cells. MicroRNA let-7 is a barrier to reprogramming that inhibits
  LIN-41, a strong reprogramming factor that is expressed in pluripotent embryonic
  stem cells. LIN-41 inhibits the transcription factor EGR1, which promotes cell differentiation
  and is another barrier to reprogramming. (Description from Worringer et al)
