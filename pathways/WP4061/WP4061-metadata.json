  "description": "The mitochondrial carnitine system catalyzes the transport of long-chain fatty acids  into the mitochondrial matrix where they undergo beta oxidation. This transport system consists of the malonyl-CoA sensitive carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane, the carnitine:acylcarnitine translocase, an integral inner membrane protein, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II localized on the matrix side of the inner membrane. (Kerner and Hoppel, 2000).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=200425 Reactome].",
