The black nodes are Key Events and green nodes are molecular pathways.   Adverse outcome pathway liver steatosis; the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes, caused either by over-nutrition, visceral obesity, metabolic syndrome, or environmental toxins. Liver steatosis can be divided into three main categories: alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic  liver disease (NAFLD), and toxicant-associated liver disease (TAFLD).[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28210688/ Review on liver steatosis]
