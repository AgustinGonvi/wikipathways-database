description: 'This liver steatosis AOP starts from the top with different molecular
  initiating events going down towards liver steatosis. The black nodes are Key Events
  and green nodes are molecular pathways.   Adverse outcome pathway liver steatosis;
  the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes, caused either by over-nutrition, visceral
  obesity, metabolic syndrome, or environmental toxins. Liver steatosis can be divided
  into three main categories: alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic  liver
  disease (NAFLD), and toxicant-associated liver disease (TAFLD).[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28210688/
