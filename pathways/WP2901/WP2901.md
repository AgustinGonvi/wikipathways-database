description: Gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH) are the key factors stimulating
  gonadotropin release from the pituitary. GnRHs are decapeptides that act via G-protein
  coupled receptors (gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors, GnRH-R). To date, several
  molecular forms of GnRH and GnRH-R have been identified in vertebrates. In most
  species, two forms of GnRH are present. one that is hypophysiotropic, stimulating
  gonadotropin release from the pituitary, and one that plays a neuromodulatory role
  in the central nervous system. The pituitary gonadotropins are heterodimeric glycoprotein-hormones
  consisting of a non-covalently linked common glycoprotein-hormone α-subunit and
  a specific β-subunit (FSHβ or LHβ) conferring their biological activity(2)
