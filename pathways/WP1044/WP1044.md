description: The ErbB protein family or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family
  is a family of four structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases. Insufficient
  ErbB signaling in humans is associated with the development of neurodegenerative
  diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease. In mice loss of signaling
  by any member of the ErbB family results in embryonic lethality with defects in
  organs including the lungs, skin, heart and brain. Excessive ErbB signaling is associated
  with the development of a wide variety of types of solid tumor. ErbB-1 and ErbB-2
  are found in many human cancers and their excessive signaling may be critical factors
  in the development and malignancy of these tumors.  The ErbB protein family consists
  of 4 members  * ErbB-1, also named epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) * ErbB-2,
  also named HER2 in humans and neu in rodents * ErbB-3, also named HER3 and * ErbB-4,
  also named HER4  The four members of the ErbB protein family are capable of forming
  homodimers, heterodimers, and possibly higher order oligomers upon activation by
  a subset of potential growth factor ligands.
