SPY	GeneProduct	AT3G11540-TAIR-G	Gramene Arabidopsis	SPINDLY (SPY) encodes for the enzyme N-acetyl glucosamine transferase that may glycosylate molecules involved in GA signaling. SPY acts as both a repressor of GA responses and as a positive regulation of cytokinin signalling. [imported from TAIR http://arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?id=36698&type=locus]
FLC	GeneProduct	AT5G10140-TAIR-G	Gramene Arabidopsis	FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is a transcription factor that functions as a repressor of floral transition and contributes to temperature compensation of the circadian clock. Its expression is downregulated during cold treatment. 
LD	GeneProduct	AT4G02560-TAIR-G	Gramene Arabidopsis	LUMINIDEPENDENS (LD) is a positive regulator of flowering in the autonomous pathway. Its functional disruption results in delayed flowering.

CRY1	GeneProduct	AT4G08920-TAIR-G	Gramene Arabidopsis	
CCA1	GeneProduct	AT2G46830-TAIR-G	Gramene Arabidopsis	CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 is a transcriptional repressor and works similar to LHY in a regulatory feedback loop.
TOC-1	GeneProduct	AT5G61380-TAIR-G	Gramene Arabidopsis	TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 is involved in generating circadian rythm and shortens the span of circumnutation rate. TOC1 interacts with ZTL.
PIF6	GeneProduct	AT3G62090-TAIR-G	Gramene Arabidopsis	PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 6 is a Myc-related bHLH transcription factor and physically interacts with TOC1.
