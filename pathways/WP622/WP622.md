description: Flowering time in a plant is associated often with the property of when
  the plant flowers. However, this property is dependent on several components of
  the environment (light, photoperiod and temperature), gene regulation, and several
  biological processes besides the genetic makeup of the plant. The time taken by
  the plant to flower also depends on when the vegetative shoot apical meristem transitions
  into the reproductive shoot apical meristem. The correct timing and perception of
  the signal are essential to successful flower development in a timely manner. In
  Arabidopsis, the day length (photoperiod) can control several plant processes including
  the flowering time. Arabidopsis is a facultative long-day plant since its flowering
  is promoted by the long days (~16 hours light; 8 hours dark), and delayed, in short-day
  conditions (8 hours light, 16 hours dark). As compared to rice which is a short-day
  plant. Flowering in rice is induced by a short day length photoperiod.
