description: This pathway shows diseases related to the biosynthesis and degradation
  of glutathione. Diseases resulting from an enzyme deficiency are highlighted in
  pink. The four genetic defects, causing the diseases, are all inherited as autosomal
  recessive traits. All patients with gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency
  are diagnosed with hemolytic anemia. Glutathione synthetase deficiency is classified
  in mild, moderate and severe. Patient diagnosed with mild glutathione synthetase
  deficiency suffer from hemolytic anemia only, while patient with the moderate and
  severe form show neurological symptoms, metabolic acidosis and bacterial infections
  as well. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 42 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360
  (978-3642403361)).
