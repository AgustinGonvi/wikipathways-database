description: 'Statins inhibit endogenous cholesterol production by competitive inhibition
  of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to
  mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. This pathway delineates
  genes involved in statin pharmacogenomics, including genes involved in mediating
  the effects of statins on plasma lipoprotein metabolism.   Sources: [https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA2031
