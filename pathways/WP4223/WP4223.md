description: Ras proteins are small GTPases and are involved in transmitting signals
  within cells. In this way, Ras signaling controls many downstream processes, including
  cell proliferation, survival, growth, migration and differentiation.   Ras proteins
  exists in two states, inactive while bound to GDP and active while bound to GTP.
  The exchange of GTP for GDP on RAS proteins is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange
  factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Activated RAS regulates cellular
  functions through a set of effector molecules, including Raf, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) and Ral guanine nucleotide-dissociation stimulator (RALGDS).  Mutations
  in Ras genes can lead to the production of permanently activated Ras proteins. Because
  these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive Ras signaling can ultimately
  lead to cancer. The 3 Ras genes in humans (HRas, KRas, and NRas) are the most common
  oncogenes in human cancer; mutations that permanently activate Ras are found in
  20% to 25% of all human tumors and up to 90% in certain types of cancer.   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4223
