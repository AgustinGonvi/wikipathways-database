description: 'Schematic representation of the metabolism of flavan-3-ols in the human
  body. Full arrows represent a direct link (most likely one enzyme or step involved),
  whereas dashed arrows represent most likely several enzymes or steps. Please note
  that the structures are found in human urine as conjugates with glucuronide, sulfate,
  and/or methyl groups. Flavan-3-ols are compounds abundant in food products like
  green tea, red wine, and chocolate. As a result of many people consuming one or
  more of these food products, the (conjugated) breakdown products of flavan-3-ols
  are often encountered in human urine. The breakdown is mostly the result of gut
  microbes that convert the food metabolites through different routes towards small
  phenolic acids and eventually benzoic acid that readilly forms a conjugate with
  glycine to result in hippuric acid, a common gut microbial product. A complete list
  of the conjugates encountered in urine after tea intake can be found with the study
  of Van der Hooft et al. (2012). The scheme was adapted from Roowi et al. (2010)
  based on the urinary compounds annotated and identified in the study by Van der
  Hooft et al. (2012).   Green tea flavan-3-ols: Colonic degradation and urinary excretion
