description: Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), a C22:5 long-chain Ï‰3 or Ï‰6 polyunsaturated
  fatty acid (PUFA), is found in algal and fish oils, created via linoleic acid metabolism
  and is a metabolite in DHA metabolism. It can be acted upon by lipoxygenases to
  produce mono-, di- and tri-hydroxy derivatives in neutrophils and macrophages. These
  DPA derivatives are another branch of the specialised proresolving mediators (SPMs)
  produced from long-chain fatty acids which have anti-inflammatory properties, even
  though mechanisms of their anti-inflammatory action have not been fully elucidated
  (Bannenberg & Serhan 2010, Dangi et al. 2010, Vik et al. 2017, Hansen et al. 2017).<br><br>The
  biosynthesis of SPMs derived from the two isomers of DPA, DPAn-6 (cis-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic
  acid) and DPAn-3 (cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid), is described here. The
  only difference between the two isomers is the position of the first double bond;
  Ï‰-3 for DPAn-3 and Ï‰-6 for DPAn-6. The products of these isomers were characterised
  by analogy in structure and action to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived and eicosapentaenoic
  acid (EPA)-derived resolvins, protectins and maresins (Serhan et al. 2002, Bannenberg
  & Serhan 2010, Serhan et al. 2015).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9018683
