description: 'An array of kinases catalyze the reversible phosphorylation of nucleotide
  monophosphates to form nucleotide diphosphates and triphosphates.<p>Nucleoside monophosphate
  kinases catalyze the reversible phosphorylation of nucleoside and deoxynucleoside
  5''-monophosphates to form the corresponding nucleoside 5''-diphosphates.  Most
  appear to have restricted specificities for nucleoside monophosphates, and to use
  ATP preferentially (Van Rompay et al. 2000; Anderson 1973; Noda 1973).  The total
  number of human enzymes that catalyze these reactions in vivo is not clear.  In
  six cases, a well-defined biochemical activity has been associated with a purified
  protein, and these are annotated here.  However, additional nucleoside monophosphate
  kinase-like human proteins have been identified in molecular cloning studies whose
  enzymatic activities are unknown, and several distinctive nucleoside monophosphate
  kinase activities detected in cell extracts, e.g., a GTP-requiring adenylate kinase
  activity (Wilson et al. 1976) and one or more guanylate kinase activities (Jamil
  et al. 1975) have not been unambiguously associated with specific human proteins.<P>The
  nucleoside monophosphates against which each of the six well-characterized enzymes
  is active is shown in the table (Van Rompay et al. 2000).  All six efficiently use
  ATP as a phosphate donor, but have some activity with other nucleoside triphosphates
  as well in vitro.  The high concentrations of ATP relative to other nucleoside triphosphates
  in vivo makes it the likely major phosphate donor in these reactions under most
  conditions.<P>All of these phosphorylation reactions are freely reversible in vitro
  when carried out with purified enzymes and substrates, having equilibrium constants
  near 1.  In vivo, high ratios of ATP to ADP are likely to favor the forward direction
  of these reactions, i.e., the conversion of (d)NMP and ATP to (d)NDP and ADP.  At
  the same time, the reversibility of the reactions and the overlapping substrate
  specificities of the enzymes raises the possibility that this group of reactions
  can buffer the intracellular nucleotide pool and regulate the relative concentrations
  of individual nucleotides in the pool: if any one molecule builds up to unusually
  high levels, multiple routes appear to be open not only to dispose of it but to
  use it to increase the supply of less abundant nucleotides.<p>Ribonucleotide reductase
