description: Citron kinase (CIT) or citron RHO-interacting kinase (CRIK) shares similarities
  with ROCK kinases. Like ROCK, it consists of a serine/threonine kinase domain, a
  coiled-coil region, a RHO-binding domain, a cysteine rich region and a plekstrin
  homology (PH) domain, but additionally features a proline-rich region and a PDZ-binding
  domain. A shorter splicing isoform of CIT, citron-N, is specifically expressed in
  the nervous system and lacks the kinase domain. Citron-N is a component of the post-synaptic
  density, where it binds to the PDZ domains of the scaffolding protein PDS-95/SAP90
  (Zhang et al. 2006).<p>While the binding of CIT to RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB, RHOC
  and RAC1 is well established (Madaule et al. 1995), the mechanism of CIT activation
  by GTP-bound RHO GTPases has not been elucidated. There are indications that CIT
  may be activated through autophosphorylation in the presence of active forms of
  RHO GTPases (Di Cunto et al. 1998). CIT appears to phosphorylate the myosin regulatory
  light chain (MRLC), the only substrate identified to date, on the same residues
  that are phosphorylated by ROCKs, but it has not been established yet how this relates
  to activation by RHO GTPases (Yamashiro et al. 2003). CIT and RHOA are implicated
  to act together in Golgi apparatus organization through regulation of the actin
  cytoskeleton (Camera et al. 2003). CIT is also involved in the regulation of cytokinesis
  through its interaction with KIF14 (Gruneberg et al. 2006, Bassi et al. 2013, Watanabe
  et al. 2013) and p27(Kip1) (Serres et al. 2012).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5625900
