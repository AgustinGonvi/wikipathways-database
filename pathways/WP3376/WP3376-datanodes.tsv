p-T19,S20-MRLC-smooth muscle/non-muscle myosin II	Complex	R-HSA-419195	Reactome	Nonmuscle myosin II (NMM2) is an actin-based motor protein that plays a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, including smooth muscle contraction, cell migration, polarity formation, and cytokinesis. NMM2 consists of two myosin heavy chains encoded by MYH9, MYH10, MYH14 (NMHC-IIA, B and C) or MYH11, two copies of MYL6 essential light chain protein, and two regulatory light chains (MRLCs), MYL9 and MYL12B. Myosin II activity is stimulated by phosphorylation of MRLC. Diphosphorylation at Thr-19 and Ser-20 (commonly referred in the literature as Thr-18 and Ser-19) increases both actin-activated Mg2+ ATPase activity and the stability of myosin II filaments; monophosphorylation at Ser-20 is less effective (Ikebe and Hartshorne 1985, Ikebe et al. 1988). Kinases responsible for the phosphorylation include myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), ROCK kinase, citron kinase, myotonic dystrophy kinase-related CDC42-binding protein kinase, and Zipper-interacting protein (ZIP) kinase. ROCK activity has been shown to regulate MRLC phosphorylation by directly mono- or diphosphorylating MRLC (Amano et al., 1996, Ueda et al., 2002, Watanabe et al. 2007).

myosin II	Complex	R-HSA-419194	Reactome	Class 2 myosins are a set of protein complexes that bind actin and hydrolyse ATP, acting as molecular motors. They consist of two myosin heavy chains , two essential light chains and two regulatory light chains (MRLCs). Smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin isoforms are a subset of Class 2 myosin complexes. The nomenclature for isoforms is misleading, as non-muscle isoforms can be found in smooth muscle. The 4 smooth muscle isoforms all have heavy chains encoded by MYH11. The non-muscle isoforms have heavy chains encoded by MYH9, MYH10 or MYH14 (NMHC-IIA, B and C). The essential light chain (LC17) common to smooth and non-muscle isoforms is encoded by MYL6. The regulatory light chain (LC20) is encoded by either MYL9, giving a slightly more basic protein that is referred to as the smooth muscle LC20 isoform, and MRLC2, giving a more acidic isoform referred to as the non-muscle LC20 isoform.  

Class 2 myosins play a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, including cell migration, polarity formation, and cytokinesis.

RHO GTPases activate
PKNs	Pathway	R-HSA-5625740	Reactome	Protein kinases N (PKN), also known as protein kinase C-related kinases (PKR) feature a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain and three RHO-binding motifs at the N-terminus. RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB, RHOC and RAC1 bind PKN1, PKN2 and PKN3 (Maesaki et al. 1999, Zhong et al. 1999, Owen et al. 2003, Modha et al. 2008, Hutchinson et al. 2011, Hutchinson et al. 2013), bringing them in proximity to the PIP3-activated co-activator PDPK1 (PDK1) (Flynn et al. 2000, Torbett et al. 2003). PDPK1 phosphorylates PKNs on a highly conserved threonine residue in the kinase activation loop, which is a prerequisite for PKN activation. Phosphorylation of other residues might also be involved in activation (Flynn et al. 2000, Torbett et al. 2003, Dettori et al. 2009). PKNs are activated by fatty acids like arachidonic acid and phospholipids in vitro, but the in vivo significance of this activation remains unclear (Palmer et al. 1995, Yoshinaga et al. 1999).<p>PKNs play important roles in diverse functions, including regulation of cell cycle, receptor trafficking, vesicle transport and apoptosis. PKN is also involved in the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by the androgen receptor. More than 20 proteins and several peptides have been shown to be phosphorylated by PKN1 and PKN2, including CPI-17 (Hamaguchi et al. 2000), alpha-actinin (Mukai et al. 1997), adducin (Collazos et al. 2011), CDC25C (Misaki et al. 2001), vimentin (Matsuzawa et al. 1997), TRAF1 (Kato et al. 2008), CLIP170 (Collazos et al. 2011) and EGFR (Collazos et al. 2011). There are no known substrates for PKN3 (Collazos et al. 2011).

RHO GTPases Activate
ROCKs	Pathway	R-HSA-5627117	Reactome	RHO associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2 consist of a serine/threonine kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, a RHO-binding domain and a plekstrin homology (PH) domain interspersed with a cysteine-rich region. The PH domain inhibits the kinase activity of ROCKs by an intramolecular fold. ROCKs are activated by binding of the GTP-bound RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB and RHOC to the RHO binding domain of ROCKs (Ishizaki et al. 1996, Leung et al. 1996), which disrupts the autoinhibitory fold. Once activated, ROCK1 and ROCK2 phosphorylate target proteins, many of which are involved in the stabilization of actin filaments and generation of actin-myosin contractile force. ROCKs phosphorylate LIM kinases LIMK1 and LIMK2, enabling LIMKs to phosphorylate cofilin, an actin depolymerizing factor, and thereby regulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Ohashi et al. 2000, Sumi et al. 2001). ROCKs phosphorylate MRLC (myosin regulatory light chain), which stimulates the activity of non-muscle myosin II (NMM2), an actin-based motor protein involved in cell migration, polarity formation and cytokinesis (Amano et al. 1996, Riento and Ridley 2003, Watanabe et al. 2007, Amano et al. 2010). ROCKs also phosphorylate the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) of MLC phosphatase, inhibiting the phosphatase activity and preventing dephosphorylation of MRLC. This pathway acts synergistically with phosphorylation of MRLC by ROCKs towards stimulation of non-muscle myosin II activity (Kimura et al. 1996, Amano et al. 2010).

Myosin phosphatase	Complex	R-HSA-419080	Reactome	All known myosin phosphatases consist of PP1 beta and both a large and a small myosin phosphatase targetting (Mypt) subunit. The large Mypt targets PP1 beta to myosin and determines the substrate specifity of the phosphatase. The Large Mypt subunit is encoded by one of three human genes, PPP1R12A (MYPT1), PPP1R12B (MYPT2) and PPP1R12C. Only MYPT1 is represented here. The small subunit is an alternative transcript of MYPT2. The function of the small Mypt subunit remains unclear, but because it is known to interact directly with myosin and the large Mypt it is thought to have an unspecified regulatory role.
