  The Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is not completely
  understood yet; conversions which are not clear are depicted with a dashed arrow.
  Two out of the three literature references provided for this pathway are for E.
  coli and could be not specific enough for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.'
