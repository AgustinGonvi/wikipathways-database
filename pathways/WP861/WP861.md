description: (From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining) Non-homologous
  end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. NHEJ is
  referred to as "non-homologous" because the break ends are directly ligated without
  the need for a homologous template, in contrast to homologous recombination, which
  requires a homologous sequence to guide repair. NHEJ is evolutionarily conserved
  throughout all kingdoms of life and is the predominant double-strand break repair
  pathway in mammalian cells.
