p-JAK1 	Protein	P23458	Uniprot-TrEMBL	The receptor chains are also utilized by multiple cytokines (Fig. 1)1,2. IL-12 signals via IL12RÎ²1 and IL12RÎ²248,71,72, while IL-23 signals through IL12RÎ²1 and IL23R69,73. In contrast, IL-27 utilizes gp130 and WSX-174, while IL-35 signals via gp130 and IL12RÎ²228. IL-35 is unusual in that it can also signals via two additional receptor chain compositions; gp130-gp130 and IL12RÎ²2-lL12RÎ²2 homodimers28.<br>Signaling via all of these receptors is mediated by members of the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) family27,75,76 (Fig. 1). JAK2 and either JAK1 or TYK2 appear to mediate phosphorylation of the IL-12 cytokine receptors family-associated STATs. IL-12 mediates signaling via pSTAT477, IL-23 via pSTAT3 and pSTAT469,73, IL-27 via pSTAT1 and pSTAT378,79, and IL-35 via pSTAT1 and pSTAT428. For IL-35, formation of a STAT1:STAT4 heterodimer is required for Ebi2/ Il12a transcription, but partially dispensable for supression28 (PMID:22814351)

Although IL25 had no effect on the activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), IL25 stimulation led to the activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A or 5B (STAT5), as indicated by the phosphorylation of STAT5 (Wu et al. 2015).<br>This is a black box event since the details about of the phosphorylated region could be incomplete.

PIP3 activates AKT
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-1257604	Reactome	Signaling by AKT is one of the key outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. AKT is activated by the cellular second messenger PIP3, a phospholipid that is generated by PI3K. In ustimulated cells, PI3K class IA enzymes reside in the cytosol as inactive heterodimers composed of p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1). Phosphorylation of both the threonine and the serine residue is required to fully activate AKT. The active AKT then dissociates from PIP3 and phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins that play important roles in cell survival and metabolism. For a recent review of AKT signaling, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007.
