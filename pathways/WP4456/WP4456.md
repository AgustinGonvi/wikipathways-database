description: Kainate receptors are found both in the presynaptc terminals and the
  postsynaptic neurons.  <br>Kainate receptor activation could lead to either ionotropic
  activity (influx of Ca2+ or Na+ and K+) in the postsynaptic neuron or coupling of
  the receptor with G proteins in the presynaptic and the postsynaptic neurons. <br>Kainate
  receptors are tetramers made from subunits GRIK1-5 or GluR5-7 and KA1-2. Activation
  of kainate receptors made from GRIK1 or KA2 release Ca2+ from the intracellular
  stores in a G protein-dependent manner. The G protein involved in this process is
  sensitive to pertussis toxin.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=451326

  - Kainate receptor subunits bind Cl- ion in the anion binding site in the ligand
    binding domain. The dimer is stabilized by the presence of one Cl- ion which binds
    within the dimer interface.
