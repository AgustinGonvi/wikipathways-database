    "description": "Pathways associated with ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Neurodivergent conditions linked in studies to these pathways include ADHD, Autism, Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Sensory processing disorders, Tourette syndrome.The purpose of this project is to create a highly detailed, comprehensive map of the metabolic pathway associated with these disorders, from indicated input vitamins through synthesis to signaling across the synaptic gap, reuptake, and catabolism (breakdown) receptors. This pathway is constructed with computational analysis and machine learning in mind. Priority has been given to ensure it is parametrically accurate, detailed, and comprehensive. In cases where there's a decision between readability and parametric accuracy, parametric accuracy is given priority.  This pathway is inspired by Kimberly Kitzerow and her meta-analysis research on the biomechanisms and pathways behind invisible illnesses. https://kimberly102347.com/the-chart/  Pathways included in this map: One-Carbon (1C), Metabolism Folate Cycle, Methionine Cycle, Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) Pathway, Neurotransmitter Synthesis, Reuptake, and Breakdown, Kynurenine Pathway (KP), Endocannabinoid System (ECS), Neuroreceptor Dynamics in the Synaptic Cleft, ROS Reactive Oxygen Stress.",
