description: The Ebola virus (EBOV) pathway represents the virus infection on humans,
  depicted from the left to the right of the picture. The initial targets are macrophages
  and dendritic cells, but the virus has tropism to infect all kinds of cells, with
  the exception of lymphocytes. Here we represent all cells in general within one
  diagram. Ebola attaches to the plasma membrane and after that, a viral glycoprotein
  induces penetration by endocytosis. This process is made by membrane proteins. During
  the penetration, its particles travel in compartments where viral glycoproteins
  are cleaved and fused to the endosomal membrane, which results in the uncoating
  of viral particles into the cell's cytoplasm. The virus then begins replicating
  and down-regulating the host's immune response. During the release process, the
  newly-created viruses are released from host cells, either by causing them to break
  apart, by waiting for their death, or by budding off through their membrane. Depending
  on the type of infected cell some trans-infection could happen.   This pathway was
  built using a text-mining approach to obtain interactions between genes related
  to this process. To our knowledge, it is the first comprehensive pathway depicting
  the Ebola pathway to date.
