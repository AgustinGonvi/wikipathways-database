  "description": "Dravet syndrome is a rare form of epilepsy. Between 70% and 80% of patients carry sodium channel \u03b11 subunit gene (SCN1A) loss of function mutations. Truncating mutations (early stop codon) account for about 40% and have a significant correlation with an earlier age of seizures onset. The mutations lead to haploinsufficiency of the voltage-gated sodium channel \u03b1 subunit NaV1.1 in the of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the brain.",
