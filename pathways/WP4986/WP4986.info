description: When the capacity of the proteosome to degrade misfolded proteins is limited, the alternate route to eliminate denatured proteins is via forming aggresomes - a process known as aggrephagy. Aggresome formation starts with ubiquitination of misfolded proteins following transport to the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) with the help of dynein motor proteins. At the MTOC the cargo is encapsulated with intermediate filament proteins to result in the aggresome. Subsequently, this aggresome recruits chaperones that result in its autophagic elimination (Garcia Mata R et al. 2002).
