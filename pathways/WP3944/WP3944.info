Description: Stress and anxiety disorders are risk factors for depression and these behaviours are modulated by corticotropin releasing factor (CRFR1) and serotonin (5-HT2R) receptors. (Source: Berg et al "5-Hydroxytryptamine type 2A receptors regulate cyclic AMP accumulation in a neuronal cell line by protein kinase C-dependent and calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanisms").  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3944 CPTAC Assay Portal]
