description: 'Ketone bodies are three water-soluble compounds (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate,
  and the spontaneous breakdown product of acetoacetate, acetone) that are produced
  as by-products when fatty acids are broken down for energy in the liver and kidney.
  They are used as a source of energy in the heart and brain. In the brain, they are
  a vital source of energy during fasting.  Source: [[wikipedia:Ketone_bodies|Wikipedia]]'
