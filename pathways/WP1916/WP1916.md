description: Platelet-derived Growth Factor (PDGF) is a potent stimulator of growth
  and motility of connective tissue cells such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells
  as well as other cells such as capillary endothelial cells and neurons.The PDGF
  family of growth factors is composed of four different polypeptide chains encoded
  by four different genes. The classical PDGF chains, PDGF-A and PDGF-B, and more
  recently discovered PDGF-C and PDGF-D. The four PDGF chains assemble into disulphide-bonded
  dimers via homo- or heterodimerization, and five different dimeric isoforms have
  been described so far; PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, PDGF-CC and PDGF-DD. It is notable
  that no heterodimers involving PDGF-C and PDGF-D chains have been described. PDGF
  exerts its effects by binding to, and activating, two protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)
  receptors, alpha and beta. These receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation.
  The phosphorylation sites then attract downstream effectors to transduct the signal
  into the cell.  View original pathway at:[http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=186797
