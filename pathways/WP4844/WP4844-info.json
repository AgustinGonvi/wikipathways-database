    "description": "The current pathway represents the different molecular interactions that may occur following the dis-regulation of signaling pathways involved in adipocyte differentiation and proliferation which may result in the abnormal distribution of white adipose tissue, leading to the onset of lipodystrophic syndromes. This laminopathic pathway stems from mutations mainly occuring in the LMNA gene can be associated with the onset of other laminopathic syndromes due to a malfunction in the lamin A processing pathway.Other laminopathic diseases are associated with LMNA mutations, thus this pathway represents the overlapping interactions involved in such phenotypic diseases.
