SLC2A4	GeneProduct	6517	Entrez Gene	GLUT4- associated with noninsulin diabetes mellitus 
Adiponectin	Protein	Q15848	Uniprot-TrEMBL	glucose regulation and fatty acid oxidation metabolism --> is secreated from adipose tissue 
MIRLET7B	GeneProduct	406884	Entrez Gene	targets HMGA2, decreasing it --> high amounts in mature adipocytes 
CCND1	GeneProduct	595	Entrez Gene	
Wnt Signaling	Pathway	WP428	WikiPathways	
Wnt Signaling	Pathway	WP428	WikiPathways	Wnt signaling inhibits protease complex to allow for beta catenin localisation into the nucleus and prevent its degredation </br>Wnt signaling functions as an adipogenic switch. When it is on, adipogenesis is repressed --> in first days of adipogenesis- differentiation is blocked
when it is off, adipogenesis is initiated. 
when disrupted = spontaneous adipogenesis </br>In Wnt signaling absence, myoblasts are reprogrammed to the adipocyte lineage and undergo spontaneous differentiation.
PPAR-Î³	GeneProduct	5468	Entrez Gene	is down regulated following overexpression of miR33B
CEBPD	GeneProduct	1052	Entrez Gene	
CEBPB	GeneProduct	1051	Entrez Gene	activated in early stages of adipogenesis --> activates transcription of PPARG and CEBPA by binding to promoter region in later stages of adipogenesis as are anti mitotic- promote terminal differentiation
CEBPA	GeneProduct	1050	Entrez Gene	is down regulated following overexpression of miR33B
WNT10B	GeneProduct	7480	Entrez Gene	upregulation will stimulate wnt signaling to down regulate adipogenesis
