description: Neutrophilic granulocytes (hereafter called granulocytes) are distinguished
  by multilobulated nuclei and presence of cytoplasmic granules containing antipathogenic
  proteins (reviewed in Cowland and Borregaard 2016, Yin and Heit 2018). Granulocytes
  comprise eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and neutrophils, all of which are ultimately
  derived from hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs), a self-renewing population of stem cells
  located in the bone marrow. A portion of HSCs exit self-renewing proliferation and
  differentiate to form multipotent progenitors (MPPs). MPPs then differentiate to
  form common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) as well as the erythrocyte lineage. CMPs
  further differentiate into granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) which can then
  differentiate into monocytes or any of the types of granulocytes (reviewed in Fiedler
  and Brunner 2012). granulocytes are the most abundant leukocytes in peripheral blood.<br>For
  early granulopoiesis the CEBPA, SPI1 (PU.1), RAR, CBF, and MYB transcription factors
  are essential. CEBPE, SPI1, SP1, CDP, and HOXA10 transcription factors initiate
  terminal neutrophil differentiation.<br>Initially, RUNX1 activates SPI1 (PU.1),
  which is believed to be the key transcription factor driving the formation of MPPs
  and CMPs (reviewed in Friedman 2007, Fiedler and Brunner 2012). SPI1, in turn, activates
  expression of CEBPA, an indispensable transcription factor for granulopoiesis especially
  important in the transition from CMP to GMP (inferred from mouse homologs in Wilson
  et al. 2010, Guo et al. 2012, Guo et al. 2014, Cooper et al. 2015). CEBPA, in turn,
  activates the expression of several transcription factors and receptors characteristic
  of granulocytes, including CEBPA (autoregulation), CEBPE (Loke et al. 2018, and
  inferred from mouse homologs in Wang and Friedman 2002, Friedman et al. 2003), GFI1
  (inferred from mouse homologs in Lidonnici et al. 2010), KLF5 (Federzoni et al.
  2014), IL6R (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 1998), and CSF3R (Smith
  et al. 1996). Importantly, CEBPA dimers repress transcription of MYC (c-Myc) (Johansen
  et al. 2001, and inferred from mouse homologs in Slomiany et al. 2000, Porse et
  al. 2001). CEBPA binds CDK2 and CDK4 (Wang et al. 2001) which inhibits their kinase
  activity by disrupting their association with cyclins thereby limiting proliferation
  and favoring differentiation of granulocyte progenitors during regular ("steady-state")
  granulopoiesis (reviewed in Friedman 2015). The transcription factor GFI1 regulates
  G-CSF signaling and neutrophil development through the Ras activator RasGRP1 (de
  la Luz Sierra et al. 2010).<br>Inhibitors of DNA binding (ID) proteins ID1 and ID2
  regulate granulopoiesis and eosinophil production such that ID1 induces neutrophil
  development and inhibits eosinophil differentiation, whereas ID2 induces both eosinophil
  and neutrophil development (Buitenhuis et al. 2005, Skokowa et al. 2009).<br>Major
  infection activates emergency granulopoiesis (reviewed in Manz and Boettcher 2014,
  Hirai et al. 2015), the production of large numbers of granulocytes in a relatively
  short period of time. Emergency granulopoiesis is activated by cytokines, CSF2 (GM-CSF)
  and especially CSF3 (G-CSF, reviewed in Panopoulos and Watowich 2008, Liongue et
  al. 2009) which bind receptors, CSF2R and CSF3R, respectively, resulting in expression
  of CEBPB, which interferes with repression of MYC by CEBPA (inferred from mouse
  homologs in Zhang et al. 2010) and represses MYC less than CEBPA does (Hirai et
  al. 2006), leading to proliferation of granulocyte progenitors prior to final differentiation.Both,
  emergency and steady-state granulopoiesis are regulated by direct interaction of
  CEBPA (steady-state) or CEBPB (emergency) proteins with NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases,
  SIRT1 and SIRT2 (Skokowa et al. 2009). G-CSF induces the NAD+-generating enzyme,
  Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT, or PBEF), that in turn activates
  sirtuins (Skokowa et al. 2009).<br>GADD45A and GADD45B proteins are essential for
  stress-induced granulopoiesis and granulocyte chemotaxis by activation of p38 kinase
  (Gupta et al. 2006, Salerno et al. 2012). SHP2 is required for induction of CEBPA
  expression and granulopoiesis in response to CSF3 (G-CSF) or other cytokines independent
  of SHP2-mediated ERK activation (Zhang et al. 2011).<br>Transcription of neutrophil
  granule proteins (e.g. ELANE, MPO, AZU1, DEFA4), that play an essential role in
  bacterial killing are regulated by CEBPE and SPI1 (PU.1) transcription factors (Gombart
  et al. 2003, Nakajima et al. 2006). RUNX1 and LEF1 also regulate ELANE (ELA2) mRNA
  expression by binding to its promoter (Li et al. 2003).  View original pathway at
