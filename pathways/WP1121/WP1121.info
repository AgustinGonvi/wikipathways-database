Description: Kit is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase, which is a receptor for stem cell factor or kit ligand. Signaling through Kit is important for formation of red cells, lymphocytes, mast cells and platelets among others. Binding of Kit receptor to stem cell factor leads to an intracellular cascade of events that includes activation of PI 3-kinase, Src family kinases and PLC gamma. Activating mutations in the Kit receptor are associated with several human malignancies include leukemias, gastrointestinal stromal tumors and mastocytomas.
