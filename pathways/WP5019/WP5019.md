description: 'Acetogenesis from H2 and CO2 in Acetobacterium woodii, based on Figure
  3 from Diender et al (2015) [PMID:26635746]. This pathway model shows both proposed
  theoretical pathways of CO conversion to acetate, as well as the acetogenic metabolism
  driven by CO co-fermented with formate. Two large complexes are involved in this
  process (top right corner): 1. the RnF complex (sodium ion transport outside of
  the cell membrane) 2. the ATPase complex (sodium ion translocation to inner cell
  membrane).'
