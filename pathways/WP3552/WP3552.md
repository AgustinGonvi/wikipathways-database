description: Genes encoding transfer RNAs are transcribed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase
  III. (Distinct processes of transcription and processing also occur in mitochondria.)
  The initial transcripts, pre-tRNAs, contain extra nucleotides at the 5' end and
  3' end. 6.3% (32 of 509) of human tRNAs also contain introns, which are located
  in the anticodon loop, 3' to the anticodon. The additional nucleotides are removed
  and a non-templated CCA sequence is added to the resulting 3' terminus by processing
  reactions in the nucleus and cytosol (reviewed in Nakanishi and Nureki 2005, Phizicky
  and Hopper 2010).<br>The order of processing and nucleotide modification events
  may be different for different tRNAs and its analysis is complicated by a retrograde
  transport mechanism that can import tRNAs from the cytosol back to the nucleus (retrograde
  movement, Shaheen and Hopper 2005, reviewed in Phizicky  2005). Generally, the 5'
  leader of the pre-tRNA is removed first by endonucleolytic cleavage by the RNase
  P ribonucleoprotein complex, which contains a catalytic RNA (RNA H1 in humans) and
  at least 10 protein subunits (reviewed in Jarrous 2002, Xiao et al. 2002, Jarrous
  and Gopalan 2010).<br>The 3' trailer is then removed by RNase Z activity, a single
  protein in humans (reviewed in Maraia and Lamichhane 2011). ELAC2 is a RNase Z found
  in both nucleus and mitochondria. ELAC1 is found in the cytosol and may also act
  as an RNase Z. Human tRNA genes do not encode the universal acceptor 3' terminus
  CCA, instead it is added post-transcriptionally by TRNT1, an unusual polymerase
  that requires no nucleic acid template (reviewed in Xiong and Steitz 2006, Hou 2010,
  Tomita and Yamashita 2014).<br>In humans introns are spliced from intron-containing
  tRNAs in the nucleus by a two step mechanism that is distinct from mRNA splicing
  (reviewed in Popow et al. 2012, Lopes et al. 2015). The TSEN complex first cleaves
  5' and 3' to the intron, generating a 2'3' cyclic phosphate on the 5' exon and a
  5' hydroxyl group on the 3' exon. These two ends are ligated by a complex containing
  at least 6 proteins in a single reaction that both hydrolyzes the 2' phosphate bond
  and joins the 3' phosphate to the 5' hydroxyl. (In yeast the ligation and the hydrolysis
  of the 2' phosphate are separate reactions. The splicing reactions in yeast occur
  in the cytosol at the mitochondrial outer membrane.) <br>Mature transfer RNAs contain
  a large number of modified nucleotide residues that are produced by post-transcriptional
  modification reactions (reviewed in Li and Mason 2014). Depending on the specific
  tRNA these reactions may occur before or after splicing and before or after export
  from the nucleus to the cytosol.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6784531
