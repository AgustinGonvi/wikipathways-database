description: Thirteen of the ~80 different proteins present in the respiratory chain
  of human mitochondria are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The circular
  mtDNA, which is present in 1000 to 10000 copies in the human cell, also encodes
  for 2 ribosomal RNAs, and 22 transfer RNAs. The double-stranded mitochondrial genome
  lacks introns and the longer non-coding region contains the control elements for
  transcription and replication of mtDNA  (Shadel and Clayton,  1997).   The two mtDNA
  strands are referred to as the heavy  (H-strand) and the light  (L-strand) due to
  their differing  G+T content.  In human cells, each strand contains one single promoter
  for transcriptional initiation, the light-strand promoter (LSP) or the heavy-strand
  promoter (HSP). Transcription from the mitochondrial promoters produce polycistronic
  precursor RNA encompassing all the genetic information encoded in each of the specific
  strands. The primary transcripts are processed to produce the individual tRNA and
  mRNA molecules (Clayton, 1991; Ojala et al., 1981). There is likely a second initiation
  site for heavy strand transcription, which produces RNAs spanning the rDNA region.
  The resulting transcript  including  the genes for the two mitochondrial rRNAs and
  ends at the boundary between the 16 S rRNA and the tRNALeu(UUR) genes (Montoya et
  al., 1982; Montoya et al.,1983; Christianson and Clayton 1986). The existence of
  such a separate transcription unit may explain why the steady-state levels of rRNAs
  are much higher than the steady state levels of mRNAs.  View original pathway at
