description: The mTORC1 complex acts as an integrator that regulates translation,
  lipid synthesis, autophagy, and cell growth in response to multiple inputs, notably
  glucose, oxygen, amino acids, and growth factors such as insulin (reviewed in Sabatini
  2017, Meng et al. 2018, Kim and Guan 2019).<br>MTOR, the kinase subunit of mTORC1,
  is activated by interaction with RHEB:GTP at the cytosolic face of lysosomal membrane
  (Long et al. 2005, Tee et al. 2005, Long et al. 2007, Yang et al. 2017). Recruitment
  of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane is intricate and incompletely understood. At
  the center of the system is a complex of two small GTPases, the Rag heterodimer
  (RRAGA or RRAGB bound to RRAGC or RRAGD). The Rag heterodimer is tethered to the
  membrane by the Ragulator complex, which also binds the v-ATPase complex. The Rag
  heterodimer acts as a cross-regulating switch, with the binding of GTP by one subunit
  inhibiting the exchange of GDP for GTP by the other subunit (Shen et al. 2017).
  The active conformation of the Rag heterodimer that recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal
  membrane is RRAGA,B:GTP:RRAGC,D:GDP while the inactive conformation, RRAGA,B:GDP:RRAGC,D:GTP,
  releases mTORC1 (Sancak et al. 2008, Kim et al. 2008, Sancak et al. 2010, Lawrence
  et al. 2018). GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanyl nucleotide exchange factors
  (GEFs) acting upon the Rag heterodimer thereby regulate recruitment of mTORC1. RHEB:GTP
  at the lysosomal membrane also binds mTORC1 and directly activates mTORC1. During
  inactivation of mTORC1 in response to removal of amino acids, the TSC complex, a
  GAP for RHEB, is required in addition to the inactive Rag complex to release mTORC1
  from RHEB and hence fully release mTORC1 from the lysosomal membrane (Demetriades
  et al. 2014).<br>Amino acids regulate recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane
  by at least 4 mechanisms (reviewed in Zhuang et al. 2019, Wolfson and Sabatini 2017,
  Yao et al. 2017). 1) Sestrin1 (SESN1) or Sestrin2 (SESN2) binds leucine and the
  Sestrin1,2:leucine complex is then released from the GATOR2 complex, allowing GATOR2
  to positively regulate mTORC1 activation (Chantranupong et al. 2014, Parmigiani
  et al. 2014, Kim et al. 2015, Wolfson et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016). 2) CASTOR1
  in a homodimer or a heterodimer with CASTOR2 binds arginine and the CASTOR1:arginine
  complex is likewise released from GATOR2, allowing GATOR2 to activate mTORC1 (Chantranupong
  et al. 2016, Saxton et al. 2016, Gai et al. 2016, Xia et al. 2016). 3) BMT2 (SAMTOR),
  a negative regulator of mTORC1 activation, binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a derivative
  of methionine (Gu et al. 2017). The binding of SAM causes BMT2 to dissociate from
  GATOR1, allowing the activation of mTORC1. 4) The amino acid transporter SLC38A9
  binds arginine and SLC38A9 then acts as a GEF to convert RRAGA,B:GDP to the active
  form, RRAGA,B:GTP (Rebsamen et al. 2015, Wang et al. 2015, Wyant et al. 2017, Shen
  and Sabatini 2018). Amino acid starvation also regulates the assembly of the V0
  and V1 subunits of v-ATPase by an uncharacterized mechanism (Stransky and Forgac
  2015) and v-ATPase is required for activation of mTORC1 by amino acids (Zoncu et
  al. 2011). Glutamine activates mTORC1 by a mechanism that is independent of the
  Rag GTPases, requires ARF1, but is not yet fully elucidated (Jewell et al. 2015).  View
