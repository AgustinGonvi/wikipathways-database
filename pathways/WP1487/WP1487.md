description: The upregulation of mucine is regulated by three different pathways which
  result in the activation of NF-kB. After TNF-alpha activated its receptor and recruited
  several adaptor proteins, the IKK complex is activated to inhibit IKBa, resulting
  in the activation and translocation into the nucleus of NF-kB and upregulation of
  mucine and IL-6. After EGFR activation by TGF-alpha binding, the RAS-MAPK-pp90 RSK
  pathway leads to inactivation of IKBa and thus to the translocation of NF-kB. Further,
  pp90 RSK leads to binding of Sp1 transcription factor to its DNA binding site.  By
  activating Tlr4, LPS can inhibit IKBa.
