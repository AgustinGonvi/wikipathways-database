  behaviours are modulated by corticotropin releasing factor (CRFR1) and serotonin
  (5-HT2R) receptors. (Source: Berg et al "5-Hydroxytryptamine type 2A receptors regulate
  cyclic AMP accumulation in a neuronal cell line by protein kinase C-dependent and
  calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanisms")'
