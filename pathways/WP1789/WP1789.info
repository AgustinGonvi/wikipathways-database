description: Insulin-like Growth Factor-2 mRNA Binding Proteins (IGF2BPs) bind specific sets of RNA and regulate their translation, stability, and subcellular localization. IGF2BP1, IGF2BP2, and IGF2BP3 bind about 8400 protein-coding transcripts. The target RNAs contain the sequence motif CAUH (where H is A, U, or, C) and binding of IGFBPs increases the stability of the target RNAs.
