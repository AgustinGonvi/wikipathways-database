and arylsulfatase
activation	Pathway	R-HSA-163841	Reactome	After translation, many newly formed proteins undergo further covalent modifications that alter their functional properties and that are essentially irreversible under physiological conditions in the body. These modifications include the vitamin K-dependent attachment of carboxyl groups to glutamate residues and the conversion of a lysine residue in eIF5A to hypusine, and the conversion of a histidine residue in EEF to diphthamide.
