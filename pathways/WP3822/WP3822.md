description: Vitamin K is a required co-factor in a single metabolic reaction, the
  gamma-carboxylation of glutamate residues of proteins catalyzed by GGCX (gamma-carboxyglutamyl
  carboxylase). Substrates of GGCX include blood clotting factors, osteocalcin (OCN),
  and growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6) (Brenner et al. 1998). Vitamin K is
  derived from green leafy vegetables as phylloquinone and is synthesized by gut flora
  as menaquinone-7. These molecules are taken up by intestinal enterocytes with other
  lipids, packaged into chylomicrons, and delivered via the lymphatic and blood circulation
  to tissues of the body, notably hepatocytes and osteoblasts, via processes of lipoprotein
  trafficking (Shearer & Newman 2014; Shearer et al. 2012) described elsewhere in
  Reactome.<P>In these tissues, menadiol (reduced vitamin K3) reacts with geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate to form MK4 (vitamin K hydroquinone), the form of the vitamin required
  as cofactor for gamma-carboxylation of protein glutamate residues (Hirota et al.
  2013). The gamma-carboxylation reactions, annotated elsewhere in Reactome as a part
  of protein metabolism, convert MK4 to its epoxide form, which is inactive as a cofactor.
  Two related enzymes, VKORC1 and VKORCL1, can each catalyze the reduction of MK4
  epoxide to active MK4. VKORC1 activity is essential for normal operation of the
  blood clotting cascade and for osteocalcin function (Ferron et al. 2015). A physiological
  function for VKORCL1 has not yet been definitively established (Hammed et al. 2013;
  Tie et al. 2014).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6806664
