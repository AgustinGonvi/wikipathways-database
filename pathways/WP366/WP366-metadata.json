  "description": "The signal transduction mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological activities of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) have been extensively studied since its discovery nearly 30 years ago. TGF-\u03b2 ligands belong to a large superfamily of cytokines that bears its name (TGF-\u03b2 Superfamily) and includes bone morphogenic proteins, activins, inhibin, growth/differentiation factors, Mullerian inhibiting substance, Nodal, and several other structurally-related polypeptides. Mammals express three TGF-\u03b2 isoforms (i.e., TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b23) that are encoded by distinct genes in a tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated manner. TGF-\u03b2 was identified originally via its stimulation of morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth in fibroblasts; however, this cytokine is now recognized as being a potent tumor suppressor that prevents the dysregulated growth and survival of epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. In addition, numerous studies have clearly established TGF-\u03b2 as a multifunctional cytokine that plays essential roles in regulating virtually all aspects of mammalian development and differentiation, and in maintaining mammalian tissue homeostasis. The pleiotropic nature of TGF-\u03b2 is highlighted by the fact that every cell in the metazoan body can produce and respond to this cytokine. Even more remarkably, malignant cells have evolved a variety of complex mechanisms capable of circumventing the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-\u03b2, and in doing so, typically convert the functions of TGF-\u03b2 to that of a tumor promoter, particularly the induction of carcinoma epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and dissemination to distant organ sites. This peculiar conversion in TGF-\u03b2 function is known as the \"TGF-\u03b2 Paradox\", which underlies the lethality of TGF-\u03b2 in metastatic cancer cells. Thus, elucidating the effectors and signaling modules activated by TGF-\u03b2 may offer new insights into the development of novel neoadjuvants capable of effectively targeting the TGF-\u03b2 pathway to significantly improve the clinical course of patients with cancer, fibrosis, or immunologic disorders. TGF-\u03b2 is secreted from cells as a latent homodimeric polypeptide that becomes tethered to the extracellular matrix by latent-TGF-\u03b2-binding proteins. Mature TGF-\u03b2 isoforms are activated and liberated from extracellular matrix depots by a variety of mechanisms, including proteolysis, reactive oxygen species, changes in pH, and physical interactions with integrins, thromobspondin-1, or SPARC. Once activated, mature TGF-\u03b2 initiates transmembrane signaling by binding to two distinct transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinases, termed TGF-\u03b2 type I (T\u03b2R-I) and type II (T\u03b2R-II) receptors. In some cells and tissues, TGF-\u03b2 also binds to a third cell surface receptor, TGF-\u03b2 type III (T\u03b2R-III), which transfers TGF-\u03b2 to T\u03b2R-II and T\u03b2R-I. Full activation of these cytokine:receptor ternary complexes transpires upon T\u03b2R-II-mediated transphosphorylation and activation of T\u03b2R-I, which then phosphorylates and activates the latent transcription factors, Smad2 and Smad3. Afterward, phosphorylated Smad2/3 interact physically with Smad4, with the resulting heterotrimers translocating into the nucleus to regulate the expression of TGF-\u03b2-responsive genes. These Smad-dependent events are subject to fine-tuning and crosstalk regulation in the cytoplasm by their interaction with a variety of adapter molecules, including SARA, Hgs, PML and Dab2, and with Smad7, whose inhibitory activity is modulated by STRAP, AMSH2, and Arkadia; and in the nucleus by their interaction with a variety of transcriptional activators and repressors that occur in a gene- and cell-specific manner. In addition to activating canonical Smad2/3-dependent signaling, accumulating evidence clearly links the development of a variety of human pathologies to aberrant coupling of TGF-\u03b2 to its noncanonical effector molecules. Included in this ever expanding list of noncanonical signaling molecules stimulated by TGF-\u03b2 are PI3K, AKT, mTOR, integrins and focal adhesion kinase, and members of the MAP kinase (e.g., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK small GTP-binding proteins (e.g., Ras, Rho, and Rac1). The interactions and intersections between canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map. Please access this pathway at NetSlim database.
