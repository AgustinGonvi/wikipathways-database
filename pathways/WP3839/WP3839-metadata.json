  "description": "Vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) must be taken up, either as carotenes from plants, or as retinyl esters from animal food. The most prominent carotenes are alpha-carotene, lycopene, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthine, and especially beta-carotene. After uptake they are mostly broken down to retinal. Retinyl esters are hydrolysed like other fats. In enterocytes, retinoids bind to retinol-binding protein (RBP). Transport from enterocytes to the liver happens via chylomicrons (Harrison & Hussain 2001, Harrison 2005).
