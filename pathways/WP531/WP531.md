description: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is responsible for correcting mismatches and
  small insertions and deletions caused during replication and recombination. In eukaryotes
  the process of MMR is initiated by MutSalpha and MutLalpha, homologs of the E.coli
  proteins MutS and MutL. MutS homologs first recognize the error in DNA, and then
  physically interact with MutL, which activates other proteins that remove the erroneous
  DNA strand and synthesize a new one.  ''In vitro'' MMR requires a nick requires
  a preexisting nick (single-strand gap) in the DNA substrate. Similarly, it is thought
  that for ''in vivo'' MMR in eukaryotes, newly synthesized lagging-strand DNA transiently
  contains nicks (before being sealed by DNA ligase) which provides a signal that
  directs mismatch proofreading systems to the appropriate strandThis pathway describes
  the slightly different mechanisms for MMR based on the location of the nick in relation
  to the mismatch (5' and 3').   Mutations in the genes coding human MutS and MutL
  homologs have been linked with the Lynch syndrome, which is characterized by an
  increased risk of developing cancer.  This pathway is based on figure 1 from [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28356513/
