description: Expression patterns of two major tumor suppressor pathways in lung cancer.
  These pathways are functionally linked to lung cancer and play role as a component
  of checkpoints and growth inhibitory pathways. Components which/who are activated
  in this pathway are given in red, those who are inactivated in blue. The dark blue
  ones are frequent and the light blue infrequent inactivated. Both, the p14ARF/p53
  and the p16INK4A/RB pathway lead to cell cycle arrest.
