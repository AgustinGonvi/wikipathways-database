description: The alveolar region of the lung creates an extensive epithelial surface
  that mediates the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide required for respiration
  after birth. Type I epithelial cells form the alveolar surface and mediate gaseous
  exchange. Type II epithelial cells secrete pulmonary surfactant, a lipoprotein complex
  that forms a thin interfacial film, lowering surface tension at the air-liquid interface
  in alveoli and maintaining the structural integrity of alveoli, preventing their
  collapse at low volumes (Agassandian & Mallampalli 2013). Surfactant production
  is increased prior to birth, in preparation for air breathing at birth (Hallman
  2013). Pre-term infants, where type II epithelial cells are not fully differentiated
  yet, can produce insufficient surfactant and result in respiratory distress syndrome.
  Surfactant is composed primarily of phospholipids enriched in phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (Agassandian & Mallampalli 2013) and the pulmonary
  collectins, termed surfactant proteins A, B, C and D (SFTPA-D). They influence surfactant
  homeostasis, contributing to the physical structures of lipids in the alveoli and
  to the regulation of surfactant function and metabolism. They are directly secreted
  from alveolar type II cells into the airway to function as part of the surfactant.
  SFTPA and D are large, hydrophilic proteins while SFTPB and C are small, very hydrophobic
  proteins (Johansson et al. 1994). In addition to their surfactant functions, SFTPA
  and D play important roles in innate host defense by binding and clearing invading
  microbes from the lung (Kingma & Whitsett 2006). Nuclear regulation, transport,
  metabolism, reutilisation and degradation of surfactant are described here (Ikegami
  2006, Boggaram 2009, Whitsett et al. 2010). Mutations in genes involved in these
  processes can result in respiratory distress syndrome, lung proteinosis, interstitial
  lung diseases and chronic lung diseases (Perez-Gil & Weaver 2010, Whitsett et al.
  2010, Akella & Deshpande 2013, Jo 2014).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5683826
