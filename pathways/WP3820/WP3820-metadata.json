  "description": "Interleukin-17 (IL17) is a family of cytokines (Kawaguchi et al. 2004, Gu et al. 2013). IL17A, the founding member of the family is able to induce the production of other cytokines and chemokines, such as IL6, IL8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in a variety of cell types, including activated T-cells. It plays a pivotal role in host defenses in response to microbial infection and is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and allergic syndromes. IL17 activates several downstream signaling pathways including NFkB, MAPKs and C/EBPs, inducing the expression of antibacterial peptides, proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). IL17 can stabilize the mRNA of genes induced by TNF-alpha. IL17 signal transduction is mediated by the cytosolic adaptor molecule ACT1 (also known as CIKS).<br><br>The receptor for IL17D is unknown (Gu et al. 2013).
