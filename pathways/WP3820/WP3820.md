description: Interleukin-17 (IL17) is a family of cytokines (Kawaguchi et al. 2004,
  Gu et al. 2013). IL17A, the founding member of the family is able to induce the
  production of other cytokines and chemokines, such as IL6, IL8, and granulocyte
  colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in a variety of cell types, including activated
  T-cells. It plays a pivotal role in host defenses in response to microbial infection
  and is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and allergic syndromes.
  IL17 activates several downstream signaling pathways including NFkB, MAPKs and C/EBPs,
  inducing the expression of antibacterial peptides, proinflammatory chemokines and
  cytokines and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). IL17 can stabilize the mRNA of genes
  induced by TNF-alpha. IL17 signal transduction is mediated by the cytosolic adaptor
  molecule ACT1 (also known as CIKS).<br><br>The receptor for IL17D is unknown (Gu
  et al. 2013).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=448424
