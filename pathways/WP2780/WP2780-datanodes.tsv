PIP3 activates AKT
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-1257604	Reactome	Signaling by AKT is one of the key outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. AKT is activated by the cellular second messenger PIP3, a phospholipid that is generated by PI3K. In ustimulated cells, PI3K class IA enzymes reside in the cytosol as inactive heterodimers composed of p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1). Phosphorylation of both the threonine and the serine residue is required to fully activate AKT. The active AKT then dissociates from PIP3 and phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins that play important roles in cell survival and metabolism. For a recent review of AKT signaling, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007.

RHO GTPases Activate
Formins	Pathway	R-HSA-5663220	Reactome	Formins are a family of proteins with 15 members in mammals, organized into 8 subfamilies. Formins are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Many but not all formin family members are activated by RHO GTPases. Formins that serve as effectors of RHO GTPases belong to different formin subfamilies but they all share a structural similarity to Drosophila protein diaphanous and are hence named diaphanous-related formins (DRFs).<p>DRFs activated by RHO GTPases contain a GTPase binding domain (GBD) at their N-terminus, followed by formin homology domains 3, 1, and 2 (FH3, FH1, FH2) and a diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) at the C-terminus. Most DRFs contain a dimerization domain (DD) and a coiled-coil region (CC) in between FH3 and FH1 domains (reviewed by Kuhn and Geyer 2014). RHO GTPase-activated DRFs are autoinhibited through the interaction between FH3 and DAD which is disrupted upon binding to an active RHO GTPase (Li and Higgs 2003, Lammers et al. 2005, Nezami et al. 2006). Since formins dimerize, it is not clear whether the FH3-DAD interaction is intra- or intermolecular. FH2 domain is responsible for binding to the F-actin and contributes to the formation of head-to-tail formin dimers (Xu et al. 2004). The proline-rich FH1 domain interacts with the actin-binding proteins profilins, thereby facilitating actin recruitment to formins and accelerating actin polymerization (Romero et al. 2004, Kovar et al. 2006).<p>Different formins are activated by different RHO GTPases in different cell contexts. FMNL1 (formin-like protein 1) is activated by binding to the RAC1:GTP and is involved in the formation of lamellipodia in macrophages (Yayoshi-Yamamoto et al. 2000) and is involved in the regulation of the Golgi complex structure (Colon-Franco et al. 2011). Activation of FMNL1 by CDC42:GTP contributes to the formation of the phagocytic cup (Seth et al. 2006). Activation of FMNL2 (formin-like protein 2) and FMNL3 (formin-like protein 3) by RHOC:GTP is involved in cancer cell motility and invasiveness (Kitzing et al. 2010, Vega et al. 2011). DIAPH1, activated by RHOA:GTP, promotes elongation of actin filaments and activation of SRF-mediated transcription which is inhibited by unpolymerized actin (Miralles et al. 2003). RHOF-mediated activation of DIAPH1 is implicated in formation of stress fibers (Fan et al. 2010). Activation of DIAPH1 and DIAPH3 by RHOB:GTP leads to actin coat formation around endosomes and regulates endosome motility and trafficking (Fernandez-Borja et al. 2005, Wallar et al. 2007). Endosome trafficking is also regulated by DIAPH2 transcription isoform 3 (DIAPH2-3) which, upon activation by RHOD:GTP, recruits SRC kinase to endosomes (Tominaga et al. 2000, Gasman et al. 2003). DIAPH2 transcription isoform 2 (DIAPH2-2) is involved in mitosis where, upon being activated by CDC42:GTP, it facilitates the capture of astral microtubules by kinetochores (Yasuda et al. 2004, Cheng et al. 2011). DIAPH2 is implicated in ovarian maintenance and premature ovarian failure (Bione et al. 1998). DAAM1, activated by RHOA:GTP, is involved in linking WNT signaling to cytoskeleton reorganization (Habas et al. 2001).

Signaling by PTK6	Pathway	R-HSA-8848021	Reactome	PTK6 (BRK) is an oncogenic non-receptor tyrosine kinase that functions downstream of ERBB2 (HER2) (Xiang et al. 2008, Peng et al. 2015) and other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR (Kamalati et al. 1996) and MET (Castro and Lange 2010). Since ERBB2 forms heterodimers with EGFR and since MET can heterodimerize with both ERBB2 and EGFR (Tanizaki et al. 2011), it is not clear if MET and EGFR activate PTK6 directly or act through ERBB2. Levels of PTK6 increase under hypoxic conditions (Regan Anderson et al. 2013, Pires et al. 2014). The kinase activity of PTK6 is negatively regulated by PTPN1 phosphatase (Fan et al. 2013) and SRMS kinase (Fan et al. 2015), as well as the STAT3 target SOCS3 (Gao et al. 2012).<p>PTK6 activates STAT3-mediated transcription (Ikeda et al. 2009, Ikeda et al. 2010) and may also activate STAT5-mediated transcription (Ikeda et al. 2011). PTK6 promotes cell motility and migration by regulating the activity of RHO GTPases RAC1 (Chen et al. 2004) and RHOA (Shen et al. 2008), and possibly by affecting motility-related kinesins (Lukong and Richard 2008). PTK6 crosstalks with AKT1 (Zhang et al. 2005, Zheng et al. 2010) and RAS signaling cascades (Shen et al. 2008, Ono et al. 2014) and may be involved in MAPK7 (ERK5) activation (Ostrander et al. 2007, Zheng et al. 2012). PTK6 enhances EGFR signaling by inhibiting EGFR down-regulation (Kang et al. 2010, Li et al. 2012, Kang and Lee 2013). PTK6 may also enhance signaling by IGF1R (Fan et al. 2013) and ERBB3 (Kamalati et al. 2000).<p>PTK6 promotes cell cycle progression by phosphorylating and inactivating CDK inhibitor CDKN1B (p27) (Patel et al. 2015).<p>PTK6 activity is upregulated in osteopontin (OPN or SPP1)-mediated signaling, leading to increased VEGF expression via PTK6/NF-kappaB/ATF4 signaling path. PTK6 may therefore play a role in VEGF-dependent tumor angiogenesis (Chakraborty et al. 2008).<p>PTK6 binds and phosphorylates several nuclear RNA-binding proteins, including SAM68 family members (KHDRSB1, KHDRSB2 and KHDRSB3) (Derry et al. 2000, Haegebarth et al. 2004, Lukong et al. 2005) and SFPQ (PSF) (Lukong et al. 2009). The biological role of PTK6 in RNA processing is not known.<p>For a review of PTK6 function, please refer to Goel and Lukong 2015.

RAF/MAP kinase
cascade	Pathway	R-HSA-5673001	Reactome	The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway regulates processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence and cell motility in response to growth factors, hormones and cytokines, among others. Binding of these stimuli to receptors in the plasma membrane promotes the GEF-mediated activation of RAS at the plasma membrane and initiates the three-tiered kinase cascade of the conventional MAPK cascades.  GTP-bound RAS recruits RAF (the MAPK kinase kinase), and promotes its dimerization and activation (reviewed in Cseh et al, 2014; Roskoski, 2010; McKay and Morrison, 2007; Wellbrock et al, 2004).  Activated RAF phosphorylates the MAPK kinase proteins MEK1 and MEK2 (also known as MAP2K1 and MAP2K2), which in turn phophorylate the proline-directed kinases ERK1 and 2 (also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1) (reviewed in Roskoski, 2012a, b; Kryiakis and Avruch, 2012).  Activated ERK proteins may undergo dimerization and have identified targets in both the nucleus and the cytosol; consistent with this, a proportion of activated ERK protein relocalizes to the nucleus in response to stimuli (reviewed in Roskoski 2012b; Turjanski et al, 2007; Plotnikov et al, 2010; Cargnello et al, 2011).  Although initially seen as a linear cascade originating at the plasma membrane and culminating in the nucleus, the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is now also known to be activated from various intracellular location.  Temporal and spatial specificity of the cascade is achieved in part through the interaction of pathway components with numerous scaffolding proteins (reviewed in McKay and Morrison, 2007; Brown and Sacks, 2009). <br> The importance of the RAS/RAF MAPK cascade is highlighted by the fact that components of this pathway are mutated with high frequency in a large number of human cancers.  Activating mutations in RAS are found in approximately one third of human cancers, while ~8% of tumors express an activated form of BRAF (Roberts and Der, 2007; Davies et al, 2002; Cantwell-Dorris et al, 2011).
