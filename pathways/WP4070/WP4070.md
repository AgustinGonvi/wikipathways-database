description: 'Human cells have more than 60 RAB proteins that are key regulators of
  intracellular membrane trafficking. These small GTPases contribute to trafficking
  specificity by localizing to the membranes of different organelles and interacting
  with effectors such as sorting adaptors, tethering factors, kinases, phosphatases
  and tubular-vesicular cargo (reviewed in Stenmark et al, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and
  Zerial, 2014; Zhen and Stenmark, 2015). <br><br>RAB localization depends on a number
  of factors including C-terminal prenylation, the sequence of upstream hypervariable
  regions and what nucleotide is bound, as well as interaction with RAB-interacting
  proteins (Chavrier et al, 1991; Ullrich et al, 1993; Soldati et al, 1994; Farnsworth
  et al, 1994; Seabra, 1996; Wu et al, 2010; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness
  and Zerial, 2014).  More recently, the activity of RAB GEFs has also been implicated
  in regulating the localization of RAB proteins (Blumer et al, 2103; Schoebel et
  al, 2009; Cabrera and Ungermann, 2013; reviewed in Barr, 2013; Zhen and Stenmark,
  2015)<br><br>In the active, GTP-bound form, RAB proteins are membrane-associated,
  while in the inactive GDP-bound form, RABs are extracted from the target membrane
  and exist in a soluble form in complex with GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (Ullrich
  et al, 1993; Soldati et al, 1994; Gavriljuk et al, 2013). Conversion between the
  inactive and active form relies on the activities of RAB guanine nucleotide exchange
  factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) (Yoshimura et al, 2010; Wu
  et al, 2011; Pan et al, 2006; Frasa et al, 2012; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness
  and Zerial, 2014; Ishida et al, 2016).<br><br>Newly synthesized RABs are bound to
  a RAB escort protein, CHM (also known as REP1) or CHML (REP2) (Alexandrov et al,
  1994; Shen and Seabra, 1996). CHM/REP proteins are the substrate-binding component
  of the trimeric RAB geranylgeranyltransferase enzyme (GGTaseII) along with the two
  catalytic subunits RABGGTA and RABGGTB (reviewed in Gutkowska and Swiezewska, 2012;
  Palsuledesai and Distefano, 2015). REP proteins recruit the unmodified RAB in its
  GDP-bound state to the GGTase for sequential geranylgeranylation at one or two C-terminal
  cysteine residues (Alexandrov et al, 1994; Seabra et al 1996; Shen and Seabra, 1996;
  Baron and Seabra, 2008). After geranylation, CHM/REP proteins remain in complex
  with the geranylated RAB and escort it to its target membrane, where RAB activity
  is regulated by GAPs, GEFs, GDIs and membrane-bound GDI displacement factors (GDFs)
  (Sivars et al, 2003; reviewed in Stenmark, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014).<br><br>Unlike
  the RAB GAPS, which (to date) all contain a shared TBC domain, RAB GEFs are structurally
  diverse and range from monomeric to multisubunit complexes (reviewed in Fukuda et
  al, 2011; Frasa et al, 2012; Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013; Ishida et al, 2016).  While
  many GEFs contain one of three conserved GEF domains identified to date  - the DENN
  (differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cell) domain, the VPS9 domain
  and the SEC2 domain- other GEFs lack a conserved domain (reviewed in Ishida et al,
  2016). Based on sequence conservation and subunit organization, GEFs can be grouped
  into 6 general classes: the DENND-containing GEFs, the VPS9-containing GEFs (both
  monomeric), the SEC2-containing GEFs (homodimeric), heterodimeric GEF complexes
  such as RIC1:RGP1, the multisubunit TRAPPC GEF, and others (reviewed in Barr and
  Lambright, 2010; Marat et al, 2011; Ishida et al, 2016). GEFs for many RABs have
  still not been identified, however.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8876198
