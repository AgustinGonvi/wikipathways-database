description: Co-transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing is not obligatory. Pre-mRNA splicing
  begins co-transcriptionally and often continues post-transcriptionally. Human genes
  contain an average of nine introns per gene, which cannot serve as splicing substrates
  until both 5' and 3' ends of each intron are synthesized. Thus the time that it
  takes for pol II to synthesize each intron defines a minimal time and distance along
  the gene in which splicing factors can be recruited. The time that it takes for
  pol II to reach the end of the gene defines the maximal time in which splicing could
  occur co-transcriptionally. Thus, the kinetics of transcription can affect the kinetics
  of splicing.<br> There are two classes of intronless pre-mRNAs (mRNAs expressed
  from genes that lack introns). The first class encodes the replication dependent
  histone mRNAs.  These mRNAs have unique 3' ends that do not have a polyA tail.  The
  replication dependent histone mRNAs in all metazoans, as well as Chlamydomonas and
  Volvox fall into this class. <p>The second class of mRNAs end in polyA tails, which
  are formed by a  mechanism similar to that which poly-adenylate pre-mRNAs containing
  introns. In the intronless genes there is a different method of replacing the 3'
  splice site that activates polyadenylation.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=75067
