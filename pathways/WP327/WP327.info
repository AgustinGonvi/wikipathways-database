Description: This pathway was created using the GPCRDB (Horn et al., 1998), http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/7tm/. The groupings are based on the GPCR phylogenetic tree available from the GPCRDB and the training sets used by Karchin et al. (Bioinformatics, 2002, pg. 147-159). The labels indicate children and grandchildren of the various classes of GPCRs as described by these references.
