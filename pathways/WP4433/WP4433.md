description: After proteins are imported into the peroxisome a subset of proteins
  are cleaved by the protease TYSND1 (Okumoto et al. 2011). Based onmutagenesis of
  human TYSND1 (Okumoto et al. 2011) and the homolog in Arabidopsis (Schuhmann et
  al. 2008), TYSND1 appears to be a trypsin-like serine protease containing a conserved
  histidine aspartate serine triad essential for catalysis. Mice lacking Tysnd1 have
  reduced peroxisomal localization of some peroxisomal enzymes and exhibit reduced
  beta-oxidation of fatty acids and metabolism of phytanic acid (Mizuno et al. 2013).
  Male mice lacking Tysnd1 are sterile due to sperm that lack acrosomal caps.  View
