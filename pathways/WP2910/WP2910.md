description: Mecp2 is in many mammals an important regulator of neuronal function
  and development. It affects all cell types, especially neurons but also astrocytes,
  oligodendrocytes, and glial cells. Mecp2 plays an important role in neuronal differentiation,
  maturation, morphology and function and influences synaptic plasticity. Mutations
  impairing the proper function of Mecp2 are mainly associated with the Rett syndrome
  but may also contribute to other neurological disorders like schizophrenia, FASD
  (fetal alcohol syndrome), PPM-X-syndrome, autism, Prader-Will-syndrome, and Angelman-syndrome.
  Dependant on the cofactors Mecp2 acts as an activator or repressor of transcription
  and micro RNA production. It affects RNA splicing and regulates chromatin structure
  together with HP1 and interferes in methylation of DNA (epigenetics). The expression
  of Mecp2 itself is highly regulated by promotor elements, cis-regulatory elements,
  polyadenylation, promotor DNA methylation and miRNA.  The pathway is demonstrated
  for mouse but as the genes are highly conserved in mammals, many of these are valid
  for human, too.
