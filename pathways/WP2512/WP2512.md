description: The cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase HER2/neu enhances tumor metastasis.
  Recent studies suggest that deregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression promotes invasion
  and metastasis of cancer cells. There is a putative oncogenic miRNA, miR-21, whose
  expression is correlated with HER2/neu up-regulation and is functionally involved
  in HER2/neu-induced cell invasion. miR-21 is up-regulated via the MAPK (ERK1/2)
  pathway upon stimulation of HER2/neu signaling in breast cancer cells, and overexpression
  of other ERK1/2 activators such as RASV12 or ID-1 is sufficient to induce miR-21
  up-regulation in HER2/neu-negative breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the metastasis
  suppressor protein PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4) is down-regulated by miR-21 in
  breast cancer cells expressing HER2/neu. There is a mechanism for HER2/neu-induced
  cancer cell invasion via miRNA deregulation. miR-21 is a potential therapeutic target
  for the prevention of breast cancer invasion and metastasis.
