description: 'Nifedipine (brand names Adalat, Nifediac, Cordipin, Nifedical, and Procardia)
  is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Its main uses are as an antianginal
  (especially in Prinzmetal''s angina) and antihypertensive, although a large number
  of other indications have recently been found for this agent, such as Raynaud''s
  phenomenon, premature labor, and painful spasms of the esophagus in cancer and tetanus
  patients. It is also commonly used for the small subset of pulmonary hypertension
  patients whose symptoms respond to calcium channel blockers. Source: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:Nifedipine]])'
