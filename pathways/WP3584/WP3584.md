description: 'MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) is in many mammals an important
  regulator of neuronal function and development. It affects all cell types, especially
  neurons but also astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells. MECP2 plays an important
  role in neuronal differentiation, maturation, morphology and function and influences
  synaptic plasticity. Mutations impairing the proper function of MECP2 are mainly
  associated with the Rett syndrome but may also contribute to other neurological
  disorders like schizophrenia, FASD (fetal alcohol syndrome), PPM-X-syndrome, autism,
  Prader-Will-syndrome, and Angelman-syndrome. Dependant on the cofactors MECP2 acts
  as an activator or repressor of transcription and micro RNA production. It affects
  RNA splicing and regulates chromatin structure together with HP1 and interferes
  in methylation of DNA (epigenetics). The expression of MECP2 itself is highly regulated
  by promotor elements, cis-regulatory elements, polyadenylation, promotor DNA methylation
  and miRNA.  Please cite this pathways as: http://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP3584  Ehrhart
