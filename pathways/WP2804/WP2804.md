description: 'The hair follicle (HF) is the biological unit responsible for producing
  a single hair shaft. The follicles are arranged with concentric epithelial progenitor
  layers surrounding the dermal core, which is the dermal papilla (DP). Classically,
  the development of the follicle itself can be divided into three stages: Induction,
  [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2839 Organogenesis] and [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2840
  Cytodifferentiation].  In HF development, the induction stage marks the beginning
  of the crosstalk between epithelium and mesenchyme. Epithelium will result in the
  placode, which will give origin to most of the layers of the HF. Then, mesenchyme
  results in the dermal condensate, which thereafter becomes the dermal papilla.  The
  first signal for induction is given by mesenchymal cells expressing WNT. Activation
  of Wnt signalling pathway blocks β-catenin degradation fate, releasing this transcription
  factor to start expression of placode formation genes. Between them are MYC, SP5,
  DKK4, SHH, EDA and EDAR.  MYC is related to the differentiation and proliferation
  of keratinocytes and stem cells migration. SP5 is capable of inhibiting expression
  of KRT10 and IVL, both associated with epidermal differentiation fate. As a consequence,
  they may be suppressed to promote placode formation.  Dkk molecules have inhibitory
  effects against Lrp5 and 6, which are crucial co-receptors in the activation of
  Wnt pathway. Dkk4 acts as Wnt pathway negative feedback loop, fine-tuning this signalling
  effects on placode shape.  SHH expression starts in the induction stage and is also
  upregulated by Wnt pathway in HF epithelium. Its signal activates Shh signaling
  pathway in the mesenchyme activating Gli, which induces expression of Ptch, increasing
  cell sensibility to Shh. Wnt pathway is able to increase EDA expression, whereas
  Eda pathway does not affect Wnt signal levels. EDAR is a direct Wnt target, and
  Activin A acts as another upregulator. Furthermore, the Eda-Edar interaction activates
  NF-kappaB, which upregulates a considerable number of genes, including SHH, DKK4,
  WNT genes as WNT10A and WNT10B, FOXI3, FGF20, CTGF and FST. WNT10A and WNT10B proteins
  activate the Wnt pathway in the mesenchymal cells, where released β-catenin activates
  expression of other Wnts and further upregulates its own expression, maintaining
  the tissue crosstalk and enhancing the signaling pathway performance.  Once the
  placode has started forming, Eda/NF-kappaB pathway has an important role in guiding
  cell proliferation. NF-kappaB and Activin A upregulates FOXI3, which has roles in
  skin appendages shape formation and possibly in placode shape patterning. Other
  genes also related to placode formation include CDH3 and GJB6, both induced by transcriptional
  activator TP63.  The Eda pathway induces FGF20 expression, which binds to Fgfr1,
  promoting the dermal condensate aggregative growth, also sustained by Versican (VCAN)
  expression mediated by mesenchymal Wnt pathway.  At induction, strong induction
  suppressor signals are present, such as Bmp, Fgf7 and Egf and they have to be inhibited.
  Molecules such as Noggin, Follistatin and CTGF act as BMP signal suppressors. Crucial
  placodal genes downregulated by BMP are LEF1 and NCAM, but BMP is also capable of
  inducing early upregulation of differentiation fate transcription factor Msx2. Two
  other signals Fgf7 and Egf direct differentiation toward the epidermal fate, instead
  of inducing HF placode formation. These signals persist during induction stage,
  and their receptors (FGFR1 and EGFR, respectively) are downregulated in the placode
  to allow the correct HF development.'
