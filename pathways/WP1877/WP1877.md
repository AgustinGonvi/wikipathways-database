description: 'Aquaporins (AQP''s) are six-pass transmembrane proteins that form channels
  in membranes. Each monomer contains a central channel formed in part by two asparagine-proline-alanine
  motifs (NPA boxes) that confer selectivity for water and/or solutes. The monomers
  assemble into tetramers. During passive transport by Aquaporins most aquaporins
  (i.e. AQP0/MIP, AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP5, AQP7, AQP8, AQP9, AQP10) transport
  water into and out of cells according to the osmotic gradient across the membrane.
  Four aquaporins (the aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7,  AQP9,  AQP10) conduct glycerol,
  three aquaporins (AQP7, AQP9, AQP10) conduct urea, and one aquaporin (AQP6) conducts
  anions, especially nitrate. AQP8 also conducts ammonia in addition to water.<br>AQP11
  and AQP12, classified as group III aquaporins, were identified as a result of the
  genome sequencing project and are characterized by having variations in the first
  NPA box when compared to more traditional aquaporins. Additionally, a conserved
  cysteine residue is present about 9 amino acids downstream from the second NPA box
  and this cysteine is considered indicative of group III aquaporins. Purified AQP11
  incorporated into liposomes showed water transport. Knockout mice lacking AQP11
  had fatal cyst formation in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Exogenously expressed
  AQP12 showed intracellular localization. AQP12 is expressed exclusively in pancreatic
  acinar cells.<br>Aquaporins are important in fluid and solute transport in various
  tissues. During Transport of glycerol from adipocytes to the liver by Aquaporins,
  glycerol generated by triglyceride hydrolysis is exported from adipocytes by AQP7
  and is imported into liver cells via AQP9. AQP1 plays a role in forming cerebrospinal
  fluid and AQP1, AQP4, and AQP9 appear to be important in maintaining fluid balance
  in the brain. AQP0, AQP1, AQP3, AQP4, AQP8, AQP9, and AQP11 play roles in the physiology
  of the hepatobiliary tract.<br>In the kidney, water and solutes are passed out of
  the bloodstream and into the proximal tubule via the slit-like structure formed
  by nephrin in the glomerulus. Water is reabsorbed from the filtrate during its transit
  through the proximal tubule, the descending loop of Henle, the distal convoluted
  tubule, and the collecting duct. Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in the proximal tubule and the
  descending thin limb of Henle is responsible for about 90% of reabsorption (as estimated
  from mouse knockouts of AQP1). AQP1 is located on both the apical and basolateral
  surface of epithelial cells and thus transports water through the epithelium and
  back into the bloodstream. In the collecting duct epithelial cells have AQP2 on
  their apical surfaces and AQP3 and AQP4 on their basolateral surfaces to transport
  water across the epithelium. Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via Aquaporins
  by regulating the permeability of the epithelium through activation of a signaling
  cascade leading to the phosphorylation of AQP2 and its translocation from intracellular
  vesicles to the apical membrane of collecting duct cells.<br>Here, three views of
  aquaporin-mediated transport have been annotated: a generic view of transport mediated
  by the various families of aquaporins independent of tissue type (Passive transport
  by Aquaporins), a view of the role of specific aquaporins in maintenance of renal
  water balance (Vasopressin regulates renal water homeostasis via Aquaporins), and
  a view of the role of specific aquaporins in glycerol transport from adipocytes
  to the liver (Transport of glycerol from adipocytes to the liver by Aquaporins).  View
