description: The first known downstream component of TLR4 and TLR2 signaling is the adaptor MyD88. Another adapter MyD88-adaptor-like (Mal; also known as TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein or TIRAP) has also been described for TLR4 and TLR2 signaling. MyD88 comprises an N-terminal Death Domain (DD) and a C-terminal TIR, whereas Mal lacks the DD. The TIR homotypic interactions bring adapters into contact with the activated TLRs, whereas the DD modules recruit serine/threonine kinases such as interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). Recruitment of these protein kinases is accompanied by phosphorylation, which in turn results in the interaction of IRAKs with TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). The oligomerization of TRAF6 activates TAK1, a member of the MAP3-kinase family, and this leads to the activation of the IkB kinases. These kinases, in turn, phosphorylate IkB, leading to its proteolytic degradation and the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus. Concomitantly, members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, Jun and Fos, are activated, and both AP-1 transcription factors and NF-kB are required for cytokine production, which in turn produces downstream inflammatory effects.
