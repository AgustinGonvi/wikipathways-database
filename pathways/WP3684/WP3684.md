description: The 22 tRNAs encoded by the mitochondrial genome are modified in the
  mitochondrial matrix by enzymes encoded in the nucleus and imported into mitochondria
  (reviewed in Suzuki et al. 2011, Salinas-Giege et al. 2015). Some enzymes such as
  PUS1 and TRIT1 are located in more than one compartment and modify both mitochondrial
  tRNAs and cytosolic tRNAs. Other enzymes such as MTO1, TRMU, and TRMT61B are exclusively  mitochondrial.<br>Modifications
  near the anticodon and near the 3' end of tRNAs tend to affect interaction of the
  tRNA with mRNA within ribosomes and with tRNA synthetases, respectively. Modifications
  in other regions, typically in the "core" of the tRNA tend to affect folding and
  stability of the tRNA (reviewed in Hou et al. 2015). The unusual modification 5-taurinomethyl-2-thiouridine-34
  in the anticodon of at least 3 tRNAs is found only in mammalian mitochondria and
  mutations that affect the responsible biosynthetic enzymes (GTPBP3, MTO1, TRMU)
  cause mitochondrial dysfunction and disease (reviewed in Torres et al. 2014).  View
