description: The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed primarily
  in urogenital precursor cells, spermatogonocytes, dopaminergic neurons, motor neurons
  and neural crest progenitors and derived cells. . It is essential for kidney genesis,
  spermatogonial self-renewal and survivial, specification, migration, axonal growth
  and axon guidance of developing enteric neurons, motor neurons, parasympathetic
  neurons and somatosensory neurons (Schuchardt et al. 1994, Enomoto et al. 2001,
  Naughton et al. 2006, Kramer et al. 2006, Luo et al. 2006, 2009). RET was identified
  as the causative gene for human papillary thyroid carcinoma (Grieco et al. 1990),
  multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A (Mulligan et al. 1993), type 2B (Hofstra
  et al. 1994, Carlson et al. 1994), and Hirschsprung's disease (Romeo et al. 1994,
  Edery et al. 1994).  <br><br>RET contains a cadherin-related motif and a cysteine-rich
  domain in the extracellular domain (Takahashi et al. 1988). It is the receptor for
  members of the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands,
  GDNF (Lin et al. 1993), neurturin (NRTN) (Kotzbauer et al. 1996), artemin (ARTN)
  (Baloh et al. 1998), and persephin (PSPN) (Milbrandt et al. 1998), which form a
  family of neurotrophic factors. To stimulate RET, these ligands need a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  (GPI)-anchored co-receptor, collectively termed GDNF family receptor-alpha (GFRA)
  (Treanor et al. 1996, Jing et al. 1996). The four members of this family have different,
  overlapping ligand preferences. GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3, and GFRA4 preferentially bind
  GDNF, NRTN, ARTN and PSPN, respectively (Jing et al. 1996, 1997, Creedon et al.
  1997, Baloh et al. 1997, 1998, Masure et al. 2000). The GFRA co-receptor can come
  from the same cell as RET, or from a different cell. When the co-receptor is produced
  by the same cell as RET, it is termed cis signaling. When the co-receptor is produced
  by another cell, it is termed trans signaling. Cis and trans activation has been
  proposed to diversify RET signaling, either by recruiting different downstream effectors
  or by changing the kinetics or efficacy of kinase activation (Tansey et al. 2000,
  Paratcha et al. 2001). Whether cis and trans signaling has significant differences
  in vivo is unresolved (Fleming et al. 2015). Different GDNF family members could
  activate similar downstream signaling pathways since all GFRAs bind to and activate
  the same tyrosine kinase and induce coordinated phosphorylation of the same four
  RET tyrosines (Tyr905, Tyr1015, Tyr1062, and Tyr1096) with similar kinetics (Coulpier
  et al. 2002). However the exact RET signaling pathways in different types of cells
  and neurons remain to be determined.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8853659

  - There are five variants of the p85 regulatory subunit, designated p85alpha, p55alpha,
    p50alpha, p85beta, and p55gamma. There are also three variants of the p110 catalytic
    subunit designated p110alpha, beta, or gamma catalytic subunit. The first three
    regulatory subunits are all splice variants of the same gene (Pik3r1), the other
    two are expressed by Pik3r2 and Pik3r3, respectively). The most highly expressed
    regulatory subunit is p85alpha.  All three catalytic subunits are expressed by
    separate genes (Pik3ca, Pik3cb, and Pik3cd for p110alpha, p110beta and p110gamma,
    respectively). The alpha and beta p110s are expressed in all cells, while p110gamma
    is expressed primarily in leukocytes. It has been suggested that it evolved in
    parallel with the adaptive immune system. The regulatory p101 and catalytic p110gamma
    subunits comprise the class IB PI3Ks, each is encoded by a single gene.
