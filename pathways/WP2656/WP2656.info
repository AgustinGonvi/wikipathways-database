description: NF-kappaB is sequestered in the cytoplasm in a complex with inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkB). Almost all NF-kappaB activation pathways are mediated by IkB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates IkB resulting in dissociation of NF-kappaB from the complex. This allows translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=445989 Reactome].
