description: 'In the G1 phase there are two types of DNA damage responses, the p53-dependent
  and the p53-independent pathways. The p53-dependent responses inhibit CDKs through
  the up-regulation of genes encoding CKIs mediated by the p53 protein, whereas the
  p53-independent mechanisms inhibit CDKs through the inhibitory T14Y15 phosphorylation
  of Cdk2. Failure of DNA damage checkpoints in G1 leads to mutagenic replication
  of damaged templates and other replication defects.  Source: Reactome http://www.reactome.org/cgi-bin/eventbrowser?DB=gk_current&FOCUS_SPECIES=Homo%20sapiens&ID=69615&'
