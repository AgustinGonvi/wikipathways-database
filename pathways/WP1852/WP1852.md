description: Porphyrins are heterocyclic macrocycles, consisting of four pyrrole subunits
  (tetrapyrrole) linked by four methine (=CH-) bridges. The extensive conjugated porphyrin
  macrocycle is chromatic and the name itself, <b>porphyrin</b>, is derived from the
  Greek word for <i>purple</i>. The aromatic character of porphyrins can be seen by
  NMR spectroscopy.<br>Porphyrins readily combine with metals by coordinating them
  in the central cavity. Iron (heme) and magnesium (chlorophyll) are two well known
  examples although zinc, copper, nickel and cobalt form other known metal-containing
  phorphyrins. A porphyrin which has no metal in the cavity is called a <i>free base</i>.<br>Some
  iron-containing porphyrins are called hemes (heme-containing proteins or hemoproteins)
  and these are found extensively in nature ie. hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is quantitatively
  the most important hemoprotein. The hemoglobin iron is the transfer site of oxygen
  and carries it in the blood all round the body for cell respiration. Other examples
  are cytochromes present in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum which takes part
  in electron transfer events, catalase and peroxidase whic protect the body against
  the oxidant hydrogen peroxide and tryptophan oxygenase which is present in intermediary
  metabolism. Hemoproteins are synthesized in all mammalian cells and the major sites
  are erythropoietic tissue and the liver.<p>The processes by which heme is synthesized,
  transported, and metabolized are a critical part of human iron metabolism (Severance
  and Hamze 2009); here the core processes of heme biosynthesis and catabolism have
  been annotated.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=189445
