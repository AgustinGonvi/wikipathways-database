description: Carbon dioxide (CO2) in plasma is hydrated to yield protons (H+) and
  bicarbonate (HCO3-) by carbonic anhydrase IV (CA4) located on the apical plasma
  membranes of endothelial cells. Plasma CO2 is also taken up by erythrocytes via
  AQP1 and RhAG. Within erythrocytes CA1 and, predominantly, CA2 hydrate CO2 to HCO3-
  and protons (reviewed in Geers & Gros 2000, Jensen 2004, Boron 2010). The HCO3-
  is transferred out of the erythrocyte by the band 3 anion exchange protein (AE1,
  SLC4A1) which cotransports a chloride ion (Cl-) into the erythrocyte.<br>Also within
  the erythrocyte, CO2 combines with the N-terminal alpha amino groups of HbA to form
  carbamates while protons bind histidine residues in HbA. The net result is the Bohr
  effect, a conformational change in HbA that reduces its affinity for O2 and hence
  assists the delivery of O2 to tissues.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1237044
