description: Interleukin 9  (IL9) binds interleukin 9 receptor  a chain (IL9R) and the interleukin 2 receptor common gamma chain  (IL2RG) to initiate IL9 signaling downstream cascade. IL9R colocalize with Interleukin 2 receptor Î± chain and MHC molecules in lipid rafts of human T lymphoma cells (NizsalÃ³czki et al. 2014). IL2RG is essential for IL9 dependent growth signal transduction (Kimura et al. 1995). IL9R (glycoprotein of 64 kDa) has saturable and specific binding sites with a Kd of 100 pM (Renauld et al. 1992). The activated IL9R complex recruits tyrosine kinase proteins from the Janus kinase (JAK) family: JAK1 (JAK1) and JAK3 (JAK3) for subsequent activation of the Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5. The activated STATs form STAT5 dimers and STAT1:STAT3 heterodimers (Neurath & Finotto 2016, Li & Rostami 2010).
