description: SUMOylation processes themselves can be controlled by SUMOylation (reviewed in Wilkinson and Henley 2010). The SUMO E3 ligases PIAS4, RANBP2, and TOPORS are SUMOylated, as is the single SUMO E2 enzyme, UBE2I (UBC9). SUMOylation affects the subcellular location of PIAS4 and TOPORS and affects the activity of PIAS4 and UBE2I.
