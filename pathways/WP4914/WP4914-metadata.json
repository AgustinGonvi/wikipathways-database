  "description": "Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network for mitochondrial Complex 1 (C1) inhibition leading to adverse outcomes in kidney, brain and liver. Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), in general, are defined as a sequence of key events that begins with a molecular initiating event (MIE) and leads to an Adverse Outcome. At that level, AOPs are described in the [https://aopwiki.org/ AOPWiki]. This AOP network is based on 3 AOPs: [https://aopwiki.org/aops/3 AOPwiki:3], [https://aopwiki.org/aops/273 AOPwiki:273] and [https://aopwiki.org/aops/276 AOPwiki:276].",
