description: The liver X receptor (LXR) is a nuclear receptor involved in the regulation
  of liver-specific processes, such as cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose homeostasis.   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2874
