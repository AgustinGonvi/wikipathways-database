Description: Inclusion body myositis is a rare muscle degeneration diseases. It is caused by presumably both genetic risk factors and environmental factors stimulated by increasing age. The mechanism of pathogenicity includes inflammation, ER stress/unfolded protein response, and disturbed autophagy, which leads to an accumulation of inclusions. The mechanism is similar to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease in neurons. This pathway is based on Figure 1 of Askanas V. et al. 2015.
