description: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease of genome instability characterized
  by congenital skeletal defects, aplastic anemia, susceptibility to leukemias, and
  cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Patients with FA have been categorized
  into at least 15 complementation groups (FA-A, -B, -C, -D1, -D2, -E, -F, -G, -I,
  -J, -L, -M, -N, -O and -P). These complementation groups correspond to the genes
  FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCL,
  FANCM, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C and FANCP/SLX4. Eight of these proteins, FANCA,
  FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM, together with FAAP24, FAAP100,
  FAAP20, APITD1 and STRA13, form a nuclear complex termed the FA core complex. The
  FA core complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes and is activated by DNA
  damage in the form of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), triggering monoubiquitination
  of FANCD2 and FANCI, which initiates repair of ICL-DNA.<p>FANCD2 and FANCI form
  a complex and are mutually dependent on one another for their respective monoubiquitination.
  After DNA damage and during S phase, FANCD2 localizes to discrete nuclear foci that
  colocalize with proteins involved in homologous recombination repair, such as BRCA1
  and RAD51. The FA pathway is regulated by ubiquitination and phosphorylation of
  FANCD2 and FANCI. ATR-dependent phosphorylation of FANCI and FANCD2 promotes monoubiquitination
  of FANCD2, stimulating the FA pathway (Cohn and D'Andrea 2008, Wang 2007). The complex
  of USP1 and WDR48 (UAF1) is responsible for deubiquitination of FANCD2 and negatively
  regulates the FA pathway (Cohn et al. 2007). <p>Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 recruits
  DNA nucleases, including SLX4 (FANCP) and FAN1, which unhook the ICL from one of
  the two covalently linked DNA strands. The DNA polymerase nu (POLN) performs translesion
  DNA synthesis using the DNA strand with unhooked ICL as a template, thereby bypassing
  the unhooked ICL. The unhooked ICL is subsequently removed from the DNA via nucleotide
  excision repair (NER). Incision of the stalled replication fork during the unhooking
  step generates a double strand break (DSB). The DSB is repaired via homologous recombination
  repair (HRR) and involves the FA genes BRCA2 (FANCD1), PALB2 (FANCN) and BRIP1 (FANCJ)
  (reviewed by Deans and West 2011, Kottemann and Smogorzewska 2013). Homozygous mutations
  in BRCA2, PALB2 or BRIP1 result in Fanconi anemia, while heterozygous mutations
  in these genes predispose carriers to primarily breast and ovarian cancer. Well
  established functions of BRCA2, PALB2 and BRIP1 in DNA repair are BRCA1 dependent,
  but it is not yet clear whether there are additional roles for these proteins in
  the Fanconi anemia pathway that do not rely on BRCA1 (Evans and Longo 2014, Jiang
  and Greenberg 2015). Heterozygous BRCA1 mutations predispose carriers to breast
  and ovarian cancer with high penetrance. Complete loss of BRCA1 function is embryonic
  lethal. It has only recently been reported that a partial germline loss of BRCA1
  function via mutations that diminish protein binding ability of the BRCT domain
  of BRCA1 result in a FA-like syndrome. BRCA1 has therefore been designated as the
  FANCS gene (Jiang and Greenberg 2015).<p>The FA pathway is involved in repairing
  DNA ICLs that arise by exposure to endogenous mutagens produced as by-products of
  normal cellular metabolism, such as aldehyde containing compounds. Disruption of
  the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALDH2 in FANCD2 deficient mice leads to severe developmental
  defects, early lethality and predisposition to leukemia. In addition to this, the
  double knockout mice are exceptionally sensitive to ethanol consumption, as ethanol
  metabolism results in accumulated levels of aldehydes (Langevin et al. 2011).    View
