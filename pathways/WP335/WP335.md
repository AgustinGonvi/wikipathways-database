description: 'S. cerevisiae synthesizes the essential amino acid L-lysine via the
  L-alpha-aminoadipic acid pathway instead of the diaminopmelate pathway (CITS: [10714900]).  Originally
  proposed to be characteristic of fungi, recent studies suggest prokaryotes also
  synthesize lysine via the alpha-aminoadipic acid pathway (CITS: [11029074]). Intermediates
  in this pathway are often incorporated into secondary metabolites.  For example,
  it has been well- studied that alpha-aminoadipate is required for penicillin production
  (CITS: [10714900]).    Regulation of the lysine biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae
  is an interaction between general amino acid control (via Gcn4p) (CITS: [Hinnebusch]),
  feedback inhibition of homocitrate synthase activity by lysine (CITS: [10103047]),
  and induction of Lys14p by alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde (CITS: [10975256]).  SOURCE:
