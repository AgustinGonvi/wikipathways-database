description: L-Serine is needed in human brain in large amounts as precursor to important
  biomolecules such as nucleotides, phospholipids and the neurotransmitters glycine
  and D-serine. The pathway for its synthesis starts with 3-phosphoglycerate and it
  later needs glutamate as an amination agent. Deficiencies in the participating enzymes
  lead to severe neurological symptoms that are treatable with serine if treatment
  starts early (de Koning & Klomp 2004).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=977347
