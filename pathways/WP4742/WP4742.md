description: This pathway depicts several metabolic pathways involved in ketogenic
  diet treatment. In hepatocytes in the liver, fatty acids (FAs) are normally transformed
  into acetyl-CoA, which can then enters the TCA (Krebs) cycle for energy production.  However,
  when FA levels are to high for the TCA cycle to be utilized completely, acetyl-CoA
  is used in ketogenesis and ketolysis. These processes are a complex process of transporter
  proteins and several other (mitochondrial) pathways [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK98219/figure/masino.f1/].
