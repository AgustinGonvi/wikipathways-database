description: Several forms of the vitamin are known, but pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)
  is the biologically active form and is a cofactor in various reactions of amino
  acid metabolism, including transamination, deamination, and decarboxylation, racemization
  and others.  In plants PLP is synthesized de novo in the cytosol by the two-protein
  (PDX1/PDX2) PLP synthase complex from pentose phosphate, triose phosphate, and glutamine
  pre-cursors (reviewed in Fitzpatrick, 2011).  PLP can also be made in chloroplasts
  or cytosol from pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) or pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP)
  by the salvage enzyme pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase.  Pyridoxine glucosides
  are major forms of vitamin B6 in plants (Gregory and Ink, 1987). The details of
  vitamin B6 biosynthesis (especially its compartmentation) in plants are far from
  being elucidated. This diagram is an attempt to capture the current state of the
  art
