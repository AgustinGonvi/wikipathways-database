description: The Pregnane X receptor (PXR, a.k.a. NR1I2) is a nuclear receptor whose
  primary function is sensing xenobiotics. It regulates the gene expression of genes
  that encode proteins involved in detoxification and clearance of xenobiotics.    Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2876
  CPTAC Assay Portal]
