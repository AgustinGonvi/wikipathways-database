description: 'Glucose repression is a widespread phenomenon in microorganisms, whereby
  cells grown on glucose repress the expression of a large number of genes that are
  required for the metabolism of alternate carbon sources. In the yeast Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae, glucose repression affects the enyzmes required for metabolism of the
  sugars sucrose, maltose, and galactose, and non-fermentable carbon sources such
  as glycerol, ethanol, and acetate, as well as gluconeogenic and respiratory enzymes
  and mitochondrial development. With very few exceptions, glucose control Is exercised
  at the level of transcription. Source: Glucose repression in the yeast Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. Trumbly RJ, Mol Microbiol. 1992 Jan;6(1):15-21. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1310793'
