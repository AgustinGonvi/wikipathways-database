  "description": "Glucose repression is a widespread phenomenon in microorganisms, whereby cells grown on glucose repress the expression of a large number of genes that are required for the metabolism of alternate carbon sources. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose repression affects the enyzmes required for metabolism of the sugars sucrose, maltose, and galactose, and non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol, ethanol, and acetate, as well as gluconeogenic and respiratory enzymes and mitochondrial development. With very few exceptions, glucose control Is exercised at the level of transcription. Source: Glucose repression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
