  "description": "The tethering of platelets to the site of vascular injury is the first step in the formation of a platelet thrombus. Firm adhesion of these tethered platelets, as well as the additional recruitment of others onto their surface leads to the formation of large platelet aggregates. The formation of a thrombus is strictly dependent on the formation of interplatelet bonds.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=76009 Reactome].",
