description: The tethering of platelets to the site of vascular injury is the first
  step in the formation of a platelet thrombus. Firm adhesion of these tethered platelets,
  as well as the additional recruitment of others onto their surface leads to the
  formation of large platelet aggregates. The formation of a thrombus is strictly
  dependent on the formation of interplatelet bonds.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=76009

  - At the sites of vascular injury bioactive molecules such as thrombin, ADP, collagen,
    fibrinogen and thrombospondin are generated, secreted or exposed. These stimuli
    activate platelets, converting the major platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3 from
    a resting state to an active conformation, in a process termed integrin priming
    or 'inside-out signalling'. Integrin activation refers to the change required
    to enhance ligand-binding activity. The activated alphaIIbbeta3 interacts with
    the fibrinogen and links platelets together in an aggregate to form a platelet
    plug. AlphaIIbbeta3 bound to fibrin generates more intracellular signals (outside-in
    signalling), causing further platelet activation and platelet-plug retraction.
    <br>In the resting state the alpha and beta tails are close together.  This interaction
    keeps the membrane proximal regions in a bent conformation that maintains alphaIIbbeta3
    in a low affinity state. <br>Integrin alphaIIbbeta3 is released from its inactive
    state by interaction with the protein talin. Talin interacts with the beta3 cytoplasmic
    domain and disrupts the salt bridge between the alpha and beta chains. This separation
    in the cytoplasmic regions triggers the conformational change in the extracellular
    domain that increases its affinity to fibrinogen. <br>Much of talin exists in
    an inactive cytosolic pool, and the Rap1 interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) is
    implicated in talin activation and translocation to beta3 integrin cytoplasmic
    domain.<br>
