description: 'Polycomb group proteins are responsible for the heritable repression
  of genes during development (Lee et al. 2006, Ku et al. 2008, reviewed in Simon
  and Kingston 2009, Margueron and Reinberg 2011, Di Croce and Helin 2013). Two major
  families of Polycomb complexes exist: Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and Polycomb
  Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). PRC1 and PRC2 each appear to comprise sets of distinct
  complexes that contain common core subunits and distinct accessory subunits (reviewed
  in Nayak et al. 2011). PRC2, through its component EZH2 or, in some complexes, EZH1
  produces the initial molecular mark of repression, the trimethylation of lysine-27
  of histone H3 (H3K27me3). How PRC2 is initially recruited to a locus remains unknown,
  however cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs and transcripts have been suggested. Different
  mechanisms may be used at different loci. The trimethylated H3K27 produced by PRC2
  is bound by the Polycomb subunit of PRC1. PRC1 ubiquitinates histone H2A and maintains
  repression.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=212300
