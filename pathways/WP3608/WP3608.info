description: Olfactory receptors are member of the class A rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) receptor molecules. They are sitting on the surface of olfactory receptor neurons in the olfactory bulb and responsible for detecting odors and initiation of signalling cascade. Humans have about 800 different genes for olfactory receptors. This gene list of olfactory receptors is generated from the gene ontology.
