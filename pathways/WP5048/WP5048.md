description: In humans, primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified about 2 weeks after
  fertilization, a time before gastrulation (reviewed in Svingen and Koopman 2013,
  MÃ¤kelÃ¤ et al. 2019). PGCs are initially located extraembryonically and then migrate
  to colonize the gonadal ridges (genital ridges) of the embryo during the fifth week
  after fertilization. At this time, either ovaries and testes can originate from
  the gonadal ridges. That is, the cells of the gonadal ridges are initially bipotential
  and remain bipotential until about 42 days after conception, when transient expression
  of the SRY gene located on the Y chromosome in male embryos is initiated in some
  somatic cells of the gonadal primordium (reviewed in Sekido and Lovell-Badge 2013,
  Barrionuevo et al. 2013, Svingen et al. 2013,  MÃ¤kelÃ¤ et al. 2019).<br>The transcription
  factors WT1, GATA4, ZFPM2 (FOG2), and the nuclear receptor NR5A1 (SF1) activate
  transcription of SRY (Shimamura et al. 1997, Hossain and Saunders 2001, De Santa
  Barbara et al. 2001, Miyamoto et al. 2008, and inferred from mouse homologs). SRY
  and NR5A1 then activate transcription of SOX9, one of the master regulators of testis
  development and maintenance (Knower et al. 2011, Croft et al. 2018, inferred from
  mouse homologs, reviewed in Gonen and Lovell-Badge 2019). Regulation of genes by
  SRY and then, when expression of SRY decreases, by SOX9 causes the specification
  of Sertoli cells that further organize formation of the testis by encasing the primordial
  germ cells in protocords, which then form fully developed testis cords.<br>SOX9
  directly activates its own promoter to maintain SOX9 expression through development
  and into adulthood (Croft et al. 2018, and inferred from mouse homologs). SOX9 and
  GATA4 directly activate DMRT1 (inferred from mouse homologs), which maintains testis
  specification by maintaining expression of SOX9 and other testis-related genes.
  DMRT1 also acts to suppress ovarian specification by binding and repressing FOXL2
  and WNT4 genes (inferred from mouse homologs). SOX9 directly activates FGF9 (inferred
  from mouse homologs), which acts via FGFR2 to maintain SOX9 expression, and PTGDS
  (inferred from mouse homologs), which converts Prostaglandin H2 to Prostaglandin
  D2, a critical hormone-like lipid that recruits supporting cells to Sertoli cells
  and acts indirectly to maintain SOX9 expression. SOX9, NR5A1, and GATA4 directly
  activate AMH (De Santa Barbara et al. 1998, and inferred from mouse homologs), an
  extracellular signaling molecule which causes regression of the Muellerian duct
  of the female reproductive system. SOX9 also directly activates many other genes,
  including DHH (Rahmoun et al. 2017, and inferred from mouse homologs), an intercellular
  signaling molecule required for testis formation.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9690406
