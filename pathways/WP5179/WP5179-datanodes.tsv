Cyp4f13	GeneProduct			However, CYP4F enzymes are likely more relevant, as over-
expression of the mouse orthologue Cyp4f13 but not of Cyp4a10 in-
creased the formation of 1-deoxySL downstream products [26]. Gen-
erally, mice express a broader spectrum of Cyp4a and Cyp4f isoenzymes
than humans [45] and therefore also seem to have a higher capacity to
metabolize 1-deoxySLs. This might explain why 1-deoxySL plasma le-
vels are lower in mice compared to humans, which should be con-
sidered when studying the physiological and pathophysiological effects
of 1-deoxySL in rodent models.
