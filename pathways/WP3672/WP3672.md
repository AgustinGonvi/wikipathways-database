description: 'LncRNA-mediated mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Mechanisms of
  tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy or hypoxia involving lncRNA include modulation
  of drug transporters and elimination, survival signaling pathways, cell cycle progression
  and DNA repair, sensitization to apoptosis, and modulation of intercellular communication
  mediated by extracellular vesicles.  This pathway is based on Fig 6 from Parasramka
  et al: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27013343  Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3672
