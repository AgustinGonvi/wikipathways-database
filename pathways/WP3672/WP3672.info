Description: LncRNA-mediated mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Mechanisms of tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy or hypoxia involving lncRNA include modulation of drug transporters and elimination, survival signaling pathways, cell cycle progression and DNA repair, sensitization to apoptosis, and modulation of intercellular communication mediated by extracellular vesicles.  This pathway is based on Fig 6 from Parasramka et al: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27013343  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3672 CPTAC Assay Portal]
