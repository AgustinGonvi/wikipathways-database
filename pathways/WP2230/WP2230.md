description: In plants the light harvesting complex around the photosystems contain
  chlorophyll a and b pigment molecules. both Chlorophyll and b helps in photosynthesis
  by absorbing light energy. Chlorophyll b is degraded into chlorophyll a and ultimately
  into phenophytins and pheophorbides.
