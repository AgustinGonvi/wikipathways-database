description: Melanin biosynthesis takes place in specialized cells called melanocytes,
  within membrane-bound organelles referred to as melanosomes. Melanosomes are transferred
  via dendrites to surrounding keratinocytes. Keratinocytes and melanocytes are collectively
  known as 'the epidermal melanin unit'. Each melanocyte is in contact with approximately
  40 keratinocytes in the basal and suprabasal layers (Cichorek et al. 2013). Melanocytes
  are distributed in the epidermis, hair follicles, the inner ear and the eye (Yamaguchi
  et al. 2007, Tolleson 2005). <br><br>Melanocytes in mammals and birds produce two
  chemically distinct types of melanin, black to brown eumelanin and yellow to reddish-brown
  pheomelanin (Ito & Wakamatsu 2008, Simon et al. 2009, d'Ischia et al. 2013). These
  differ in their responses to UV radiation; eumelanin has the ability to convert
  absorbed light energy into heat energy (Meredith & Riesz 2004) and to detoxify reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) (Bustamante et al. 1993), while pheomelanin is a phototoxic
  pro-oxidant (Samokhvalov 2005). Most natural melanin pigments contain eumelanin
  and pheomelanin (Ito & Wakamatsu 2003) and are termed 'mixed' melanins. Neuromelanins
  are mixed melanin-like pigments which are mainly found in neurons of the substantia
  nigra and locus coeruleus (Fedorow et al. 2005). Synthesis of NM may prevent the
  accumulation of toxic catechol derivatives (Zecca et al. 2003). NM can sequester
  a variety of potentially damaging molecules such as beta-carbolines, heavy metal
  ions and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (D'Amato et al. 1986), a drug which
  causes Parkinson's Disease-like symptoms.  Models suggest that mixed melanogenesis
  occurs in three stages (Ito et al. 2000). The initial stage of melanin biosynthesis
  is the production of cysteinyldopas, which continues while sufficient cysteine is
  available. The second stage is the oxidation of cysteinyldopas to produce pheomelanin,
  which continues while cysteinyldopa concentration is sufficiently high. The last
  stage is the production of eumelanin, which begins when cysteinyldopas and cysteine
  are depleted. The ratio of eumelanin to pheomelanin is determined by tyrosinase
  activity and the availability of tyrosine and cysteine (Land et al. 2003).  View
