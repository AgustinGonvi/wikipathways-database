description: Control of immune tolerance by VIP controls immune homeostasis.  Vasoactive
  intestinal peptide (VIP) is released from nerve terminals (nervous source) and blood
  (endocrine source), or produced by T helper 2 (TH2) cells or macrophages (immune
  source) in response to antigenic and inflammatory stimulation. VIP induces immune
  tolerance and inhibits the autoimmune response through different non-excluding mechanisms.
  First, it induces the generation and differentiation of TH2-cell functions and decrease
  TH1-cell functions through direct actions on differentiating T cells, or indirectly
  by regulating antigen presenting cell (APC) functions. As a consequence, the inflammatory
  and autoimmune responses are impaired, and the anti-helminthic and atopic responses
  are increased, because the infiltration and activation of neutrophils and macrophages
  by interferon-γ (IFNγ) and the production of complement-activating IgG2 antibodies
  are avoided. Second, VIP impairs the co-stimulatory activity of APCs on effector
  T cells, inhibiting subsequent clonal expansion. This avoids the inflammatory response
  and its cytotoxic effect against the target tissue. Third, VIP induces the generation
  of regulatory T cells that suppress the activation of autoreactive T cells by producing
  interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ). This effect contributes
  to the maintenance of an anti-inflammatory state and restores immune tolerance.
