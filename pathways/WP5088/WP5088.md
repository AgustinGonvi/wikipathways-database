description: 'This pathway describes elements of Prostaglandin signaling in Homo sapiens
  affected by COVID-19. Prostaglandins are amongst the many inflammatory mediators
  that incite a cytokine storm in COVID-19 after Bradykinin receptor B1 (BDKRB1) activation.
  This pathway mainly focuses on PGE2 and PGI2 and their interactions that lead to
  hyperinflammation via cytokine storms, immunothrombosis as well as the recruitment
  of fibrosis-mediating factors (VEGF, TGFB1, AREG). These pathways take place in
  multiple cell types such as: Monocytes, Macrophages, Fibroblasts, Th17 cells, Nk
  cells, et cetera.'
