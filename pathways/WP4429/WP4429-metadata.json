  "description": "All neurotrophins (NTs) are generated as pre-pro-neurotrophin precursors. The signal peptide is cleaved off as NT is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The resulting pro-NT can form a homodimer spontaneously which then transits to the Golgi apparatus and then onto the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Resident protein convertases (PCs) can cleave off the pro-sequence and mature NT is is targeted to constitutively released vesicles. The pro-NT form can also be released to the extracellular region.
