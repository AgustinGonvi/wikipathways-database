description: All neurotrophins (NTs) are generated as pre-pro-neurotrophin precursors.
  The signal peptide is cleaved off as NT is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). The resulting pro-NT can form a homodimer spontaneously which then transits
  to the Golgi apparatus and then onto the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Resident protein
  convertases (PCs) can cleave off the pro-sequence and mature NT is is targeted to
  constitutively released vesicles. The pro-NT form can also be released to the extracellular
  region.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=167060
