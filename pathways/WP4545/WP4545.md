description: 'The Oxysterol group of compounds are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol
  or its sterol precursors, e.g. 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) or desmosterol. There
  are three mechanisms leading to the formation of oxysterols:   1. Enzymatically
  (first steps of sterol metabolism, being intermediates for the formation of steroid
  hormones, bile acids and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3).  2. Non-enzymatically by encountering
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), providing a second pool of metabolites (this pool
  also includes oxidized cholesterol molecules taken in from diet), see [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5064
  WP5064].  3. Generation by the gut microflora and uptake through the enterohepatic
  circulation.   Previously oxysterols where though to be inactive metabolic intermediates,
  however recent findings have established that these metabolites are involved in
  cholesterol homoeostasis, can be ligands to nuclear and G protein-coupled receptors
  and biomarkers of diseases (for example Niemann-Pick disease).  This pathway drawing
  was inspired by Figure 3 of the review article by Griffiths et al. (2016) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27068984],
  and has been extended with immune system, receptor agonists, steroidal alkaloid
  and biomarker information from the same paper. This pathway has been updated with
  Figure 1 from Griffiths et al (2020) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.prostaglandins.2019.106381]
  (green boxes), Figure 2 (yellow box) and Figure 3 (blue box).'
