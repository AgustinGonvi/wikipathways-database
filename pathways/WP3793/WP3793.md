description: N-Glycosylation is one of the most common co- and posttranslational modifications
  of eukaryotic proteins occurring in the ER lumen. N-glycosylation plays pivotal
  roles in protein folding and intra- or inter-cellular trafficking of N-glycosylated
  proteins. Quality control mechanisms in the ER sift out incorrectly-folded proteins
  from correctly-folded proteins, the former then destined for degradation. Incorrectly-folded
  N-glycans are exported to the cytosol where the process of degradation begins. Once
  the unfolded protein is cleaved from the oligosaccharide (forming free oligosaccharides,
  fOS), step-wise degradation of mannose moieties, both in the cytosol (Suzuki & Harada
  2014) and then in the lysosome (Aronson & Kuranda 1989, Winchester 2005), results
  in complete degradation. Breakdown must be complete to avoid lysosomal storage diseases
  that occur when fragments as small as dimers are left undigested.  View original
