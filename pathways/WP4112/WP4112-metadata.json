  "description": "Vitamins A, D, E and K are lipophilic compounds, the so-called fat-soluble vitamins. Because of their lipophilicity, fat-soluble vitamins are solubilised and transported by intracellular carrier proteins to exert their actions. Alpha-tocopherol, the main form of vitamin E found in the body, is transported by alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (TTPA) in hepatic cells (Kono & Arai 2015, Schmolz et al. 2016).
