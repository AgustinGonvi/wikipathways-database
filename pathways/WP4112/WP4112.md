description: Vitamins A, D, E and K are lipophilic compounds, the so-called fat-soluble
  vitamins. Because of their lipophilicity, fat-soluble vitamins are solubilised and
  transported by intracellular carrier proteins to exert their actions. Alpha-tocopherol,
  the main form of vitamin E found in the body, is transported by alpha-tocopherol
  transfer protein (TTPA) in hepatic cells (Kono & Arai 2015, Schmolz et al. 2016).  View
