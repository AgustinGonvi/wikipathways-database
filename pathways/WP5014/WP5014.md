description: 'Herpesviruses have a unique four-layered structure: a core containing
  the large, double-stranded DNA genome is enclosed by an icosapentahedral capsid
  which is composed of capsomers. The capsid is surrounded by an amorphous protein
  coat called the tegument. It is encased in a glycoprotein-bearing lipid bilayer
  envelope.<br>  Herpesviruses are divided into three groups: alpha-herpesviruses,
  beta-herpesviruses, and gamma-herpesviruses. The beta herpesviruses have a restricted
  host range. Their reproductive life cycle is long (days), with infection progressing
  slowly in cell culture systems. These viruses cause their host cells to enlarge,
  as exemplified by a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. These viruses can establish
  latent infection in secretory glands, cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and
  the kidneys.<br>  Human Cytomegalovirus, or HCMV, is a common virus that infects
  people of all ages. In the United States, nearly one in three children are already
  infected with HCMV by age 5 years. Over half of adults by age 40 have been infected
  with HCMV. Once HCMV is in a personâ€™s body, it stays there for life and can reactivate.<br>  Cytomegalovirus
  causes three clinical syndromes:<br>  (1) Congenital cytomegalovirus infection (when
  symptomatic) causes hepatosplenomegaly, retinitis, rash, and central nervous system
  involvement.<br>  (2) In about 10 per cent of older children and adults, primary
  cytomegalovirus infection causes a mononucleosis syndrome with fever, malaise, atypical
  lymphocytosis, and pharyngitis.<br>  (3) Immunocompromised hosts (transplant recipients
  and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-infected individuals) may develop life-threatening
  disseminated disease involving the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, retina,
  and central nervous system.<br>  Experimentally HCMV can be propagated in multiple
  cell lines. When propagated in human fibroblasts, HCMV clinical isolates acquire
  mutations in a manner that suggests a process of adaptation. Two strains of HCMV
  AD169 (grown from cultures of adenoid tissue taken from a 7-year-old girl) and Towne
  (developed as an attenuated vaccine by passaging 125 times in vitro) were initially
  used as the primary clinical strains. As only 26 % of HCMV canonical genes (45/171)
  are essential for viral replication in vitro it became important that a model strain
  be developed.<br>  The Merlin BAC was derived for this use. Produced using a bacterial
  artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning system (to avoid adaptation/degradation of the
  genome with each passage) the Merlin strain contains a complete HCMV genome that
  is thought to accurately to represent the original clinical agent from which it
  was derived. It is also a reproducible source of clonal virus (via transfection)
  and is capable of reconstituting phenotypically wild-type virus.<br><br>The lifecycle
  represented here uses the Merlin strain where possible.Infectious Human Cytomegalovirus
  (HCMV) particles enter the cell through interaction with cellular receptors. Once
  in the cytoplasm capsid and tegument proteins are delivered to the cytosol. The
  capsid travels to the nucleus, where the genome is delivered and circularized. Tegument
  proteins regulate host cell responses and initiate the expression of viral I immediate
  early genes. This is followed by delayed early genes, which initiate viral genome
  replication, then late genes. Late gene expression initiates capsid assembly in
  the nucleus, followed by nuclear egress to the cytosol. Capsids associate with tegument
  proteins in the cytosol and are trafficked to the viral assembly complex that contains
  components from the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and endosomal machinery.
  The capsids acquire additional tegument proteins and a viral envelope by budding
  into intracellular vesicles. These vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release
  enveloped infectious particles along with non-infectious dense bodies.  View original
