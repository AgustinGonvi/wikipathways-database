description: The kinases of the integrated stress response phosphorylate EIF2S1 (eIF2-alpha)
  to regulate cellular translation. The kinases comprise PERK (also called EIF2AK3),
  which responds to unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum; EIF2AK2 (also called
  PKR), which responds to cytosolic double-stranded RNA; EIF2AK4 (also called GCN2),
  which responds to amino acid deficiency; and EIF2AK1 (also called heme-regulated
  inhibitor, HRI, and heme-controlled repressor, HCR), which responds to heme deficiency
  and cytosolic unfolded protein. Each molecule of EIF2AK1 binds two molecules of
  heme, one bound near the N-terminus and one bound at the kinase insert (KI) domain
  that inhibits the kinase activity of EIF2AK1 (inferred from the rabbit homolog in
  Chefalo et al. 1998, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2000, inferred from the mouse homolog in
  Misanova et al. 2006, Hirai et al. 2007, Igarashi et al. 2008). Dissociation of
  heme from the KI domain activates the kinase activity of EIF2AK1, which autophosphorylates
  (inferred from the mouse homolog in Bauer et al. 2001, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2003,
  Igarashi et al. 2011) and then phosphorylates EIF2S1 (Bhavnani et al. 2018, inferred
  from the rabbit homologs in Chefalo et al. 1998, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2000, inferred
  from the mouse homologs in Lu et al. 2001, Rafie-Kolpin et al. 2003, Igarashi et
  al. 2011).<br>Phosphorylated EIFS1 causes a reduction in general cellular translation
  and thereby coordinates globin synthesis with heme availability during erythropoiesis
  (inferred from mouse knockout in Han et al. 2001, reviewed in Chen et al. 2014).
  Translation of mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomal proteins is most severely reduced,
  causing a decrease in cellular protein synthesis (inferred from mouse homologs in
  Zhang et al. 2019). Lack of EIF2AK1 causes accumulation of unfolded globins devoid
  of heme and consequent anemia in iron-deficient mice (inferred from mouse knockout
  in Han et al. 2001). Activation of the cytoplasmic unfolded protein response and
  impaired mitochondrial respiration are also observed in HRI deficiency (inferred
  from mouse homologs in Zhang et al. 2019).<br>Phosphorylation of EIFS1 activates
  translation of certain mRNAs such as ATF4, ATF5, and DDIT3 (CHOP) that have upstream
  ORFs (inferred from mouse homologs in Harding et al. 2000). ATF4 in turn activates
  programs of gene expression that ameliorate effects of the stress to maintain mitochondrial
  function, redox homeostasis, and erythroid differentiation (inferred from mouse
  homologs in Zhang et al. 2019). Unresolved stress, however, can eventually lead
  to apoptosis regulated by DDIT3. EIF2AK1 also represses mTORC1 (mechanistic target
  of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) signaling via ATF4-mediated induction
  of GRB10 as a feedback mechanism to attenuate erythropoietin-mTORC1-stimulated ineffective
  erythropoiesis in iron deficiency anemia (inferred from mouse homologs in Zhang
  et al. 2018 and Zhang et. al. 2019).<br>EIF2AK1 is also activated by heat shock,
  arsenite (oxidative stress), and osmotic stress (inferred from mouse homologs in
  Lu et al. 2001). The mechanisms by which these stresses act on EIF2AK1 are independent
  of heme but are not yet fully elucidated. Furthermore, EIF2AK1 is involved in the
  production of human fetal hemoglobin, and EIF2AK1-mediated stress response has emerged
  as a potential therapeutic target for hemoglobinopathies (reviewed in Chen and Zhang
  2019).<br>In addition to regulation of erythropoiesis, EIF2AK1 shows effects outside
  of the erythroid lineage, including requirement for the maturation and functions
  of macrophages (inferred from mouse homologs in Liu et al. 2007),  reduction in
  endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes, activation of hepatic expression of
  fibroblast growth factor, and mediation of translation of GRIN2B (GluN2B. a subunit
  of the NMDA receptor) and BACE1 in the nervous system (reviewed in Burwick and Aktas
  2017). HRI-integrated stress response is activated in human cancer cell lines and
  primary multiple myeloma cells, and has emerged as a molecular target of anticancer
  agents  (reviewed in Burwick and Aktas 2017; reviewed in Chen and Zhang 2019).  View
