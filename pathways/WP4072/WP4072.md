description: Glycogen, a highly branched glucose polymer, is formed and broken down
  in most human tissues, but is most abundant in liver and muscle, where it serves
  as a major stored fuel. Glycogen metabolism has been studied in most detail in liver
  and skeletal muscle. Glycogen metabolism in other tissues has not been studied as
  extensively, and is thought to resemble the muscle process.<br>Glycogen synthesis
  involves five reactions. The first two, conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose
  1-phosphate and synthesis of UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP, are shared
  with several other pathways. The next three reactions, the auto-catalyzed synthesis
  of a glucose oligomer on glycogenin, the linear extension of the glucose oligomer
  catalyzed by glycogen synthase, and the formation of branches catalyzed by glycogen
  branching enzyme, are unique to glycogen synthesis. Repetition of the last two reactions
  generates large, extensively branched glycogen polymers. The catalysis of glycogenin
  glucosylation and oligoglucose chain extension by distinct isozymes in liver and
  nonhepatic tissues allows them to be regulated independently (Agius 2008; Bollen
  et al. 1998; Roach et al. 2012).<br>Cytosolic glycogen breakdown occurs via the
  same chemical steps in all tissues but is separately regulated via tissue specific
  isozymes and signaling pathways that enable distinct physiological fates for glycogen
  in liver and other tissues. Glycogen phosphorylase, which can be activated by phosphorylase
  kinase, catalyzes the removal of glucose residues as glucose 1-phosphate from the
  ends of glycogen branches. The final four residues of each branch are removed in
  two steps catalyzed by debranching enzyme, and further glycogen phosphorylase activity
  completes the process of glycogen breakdown. The first glucose residue in each branch
  is released as free glucose; all other residues are released as glucose 1-phosphate.
  The latter molecule can be converted to glucose 6-phosphate in a step shared with
  other pathways (Villar-Palasi & Larner 1970; Hers 1976).<br>Glycogen can also be
  taken up into lysosomes, where it is normally broken done by the action of a single
  enzyme, lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (GAA) (Brown et al. 1970).  View original pathway
