description: 'Glycerophospholipids or phosphoglycerides, in which the hydrophobic
  regions are composed of two fatty acids joined to glycerol; and sphingolipids, in
  which a single fatty acid is joined to a fatty amine, sphingosine, are glycerol-based
  phospholipids and the main component of biological membranes. The hydrophilic moieties
  in these amphipathic compounds may be as a simple as a single -OH at one end of
  the sterol ring system, or they may be more complex. Glycerophospholipds, as well
  as sphingolipids, contained polar or charged alcohols at their polar ends; some
  also contain phosphate groups.  In glycerophospholipids, two fatty acids are ester-linked
  to glycerol at C-1 and C-2, and a highly polar or charged (and therefore hydrophilic)
  head group is attached to C-3 through a phosphodiester bond. All glycerophospholipds
  are derivatives of phosphatidic acid and are named for their polar head groups (e.g.,
  phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine). All have a negative charge on
  the phosphate group at pH 7.0. The head-goup alcohol may also contribute one or
  more charges at pH near 7.0. The fatty acids in glycerophospholipds can be any of
  a wide variety. They are different in different species, in different tissues of
  the same species, and in different types of glycerophospholipids in the same cell
  or tissue. In general, glycerophospholipids contain a saturated fatty acid at C-1
  and an unsaturated fatty acid at C-2, and, in general terms, the fatty acyl groups
  are generally 16 or 18 carbons long.  Eukaryotic membranes contain significant amounts
  of two other types of glycerophospholipids: Plasmalogens and Alkylacylglycerophospholipids.
  Plasmalogens contain a hydrocarbon chain linked to glycerol C-1 via vinyl ether
  linkage whereas alkylacylglycerophospholipids the alkyl substituent at glycerol
  C-1 is attached via an ether linkage. About 20% of mammalian glycerophospholipids
  are plasmalogens, this percentage varies both from species to species and from tissue
  to tissue within a given organism. While plasmalogens comprise only about 0.8% of
  the phospholipids in human liver, they account for around 23% of those in human
  nervous tissue. The alkylacylglycerophospholipids are less abundant than the plasmalogens,
  e.g., about 59% of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of human heart are plasmalogens,
  whereas only 3.6% are alkylacylglycerophospholipids. However, in bovine erythrocytes,
  75% of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipids are of alkylacyl type.'
