Description: This pathway is based on Figure 4 of "A Model of an Integrated Immune System Pathway in Homo sapiens and Its Interaction with Superantigen Producing Expression Regulatory Pathway in Staphylococcus aureus: Comparing Behavior of Pathogen Perturbed and Unperturbed Pathway"(see bibliography). The pathway displays the T-cell receptors of homo sapiens when infected with the disease Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B. The binding of a superantigen to the T cell receptor results in a protein signaling pathway resulting in cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune response due to altered DNA expression. SEB refers to Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B.
