description: 'As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate de novo pathway,
  in which the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate (see NAD biosynthesis
  I (from aspartate)). In eukaryotes, the de novo pathway starts with tryptophan (this
  pathway).  The role of tryptophan as a precursor in eukaryotic NAD biosynthesis
  was first suggested by nutritional studies in which humans stricken with pellagra,
  a nicotinamide (niacine) deficiency disease, recovered after the addition of tryptophan
  or niacin to their diets [Krehl45]. Other studies established tryptophan as a precursor
  of NAD in many animal and plant systems [Foster80a]. This pathway is closely related
  to the catabolic pathway of tryptophan (tryptophan degradation I (via anthranilate)),
  suggesting an evolutionary link between the two.  Though rare, the synthesis of
  NAD from tryptophan in prokaryotes has been observed in several organisms. Wilson
  and Henderson reported that Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni requires niacin for
  growth and can use tryptophan or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid as a substitute [Wilson63].
  Some members of the Actinomycete group were also reported to utilize tryptophan
  for NAD biosynthesis [Lingens64].  Recent studies based on comparative genome analysis
  have identified the five genes involved in the "eukaryotic" pathway in several bacterial
  strains, confirming that some bacteria may indeed utilize this pathway rather than
  the aspartate pathway [Kurnasov03].  In yeast, the de novo pathway consists of six
  enzymatic steps (catalyzed by the products of the BNA genes) and one non-enzymatic
  reaction. After the last enzymatic reaction (catalyzed by Bna6p), the de novo pathway
  converges with the salvage pathway [Panozzo02].  In plants:  In plants current evidence
  strongly supports the NAD biosynthetic route from L-aspartate (NAD biosynthesis
  I (from aspartate)). However, the finding of gene homologs encoding enzymes of the
  early steps in the kynurenine pathway (this pathway) in the genome sequence of rice
  (Oryza sativa) does not rule out this pathway in monocotyledones and remains to
  be further investigated [Katoh06] [Katoh04].'
