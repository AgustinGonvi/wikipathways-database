  "description": "Chromatin organization refers to the composition and conformation of complexes between DNA, protein and RNA. It is determined by processes that result in the specification, formation or maintenance of the physical structure of eukaryotic chromatin. These processes include histone modification, DNA modification, and transcription. The modifications are bound by specific proteins that alter the conformation of chromatin.
