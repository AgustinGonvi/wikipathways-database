description: This is a schematic diagram illustrating putative pathways for NAMP (nanomaterial-associated
  molecular patters)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) eg. lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are recognized by Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) on the cell membrane, which leads to NF-κB activation and upregulation of
  pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and NLRP3 expression. High aspect radio nanomaterials (i.e.
  long multiwalled carbon nanotubes) are thought to trigger “frustrated phagocytosis”
  in macrophages, leading to NADPH oxidase activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  generation and inflammasome activation. Smaller nanomaterials (i.e. short carbon
  nanotubes or silver nanoparticles of 28 nm), on the other hand, could be phagocytosed
  and once inside the cell induce lysosomal damage leading to release of cathepsins
  which cause mitochondrial damage and ROS production. In both cases, interaction
  of phagocytes with NAMPs induces an overproduction of ROS which results in assembly
  of NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and pro-caspase-1
  into the multimeric inflammasome complex, resulting in activation of caspase-1,
  and release of mature IL-1β, a key pro-inflammatory mediator.
