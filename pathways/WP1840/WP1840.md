description: 'The Interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-5 and Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
  factor (GM-CSF) receptors form a family of heterodimeric receptors that have specific
  alpha chains but share a common beta subunit, often referred to as the common beta
  (Bc). Both subunits contain extracellular conserved motifs typical of the cytokine
  receptor superfamily. The cytoplasmic domains have limited similarity with other
  cytokine receptors and lack detectable catalytic domains such as tyrosine kinase
  domains.<br><br> IL-3 is a 20-26 kDa product of CD4+ T cells that acts on the most
  immature marrow progenitors. IL-3 is capable of inducing the growth and differentiation
  of multi-potential hematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes,
  macrophages, lymphoid and erythroid cells. IL-3 has been used to support the proliferation
  of murine cell lines with properties of multi-potential progenitors, immature myeloid
  as well as T and pre-B lymphoid cells (Miyajima et al. 1992). IL-5 is a hematopoietic
  growth factor responsible for the maturation and differentiation of eosinophils.
  It was originally defined as a T-cell-derived cytokine that triggers activated B
  cells for terminal differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. It also
  promotes the generation of cytotoxic T-cells from thymocytes. IL-5 induces the expression
  of IL-2 receptors (Kouro & Takatsu 2009). GM-CSF is produced by cells (T-lymphocytes,
  tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells) found at sites of inflammatory
  responses. It stimulates the growth and development of progenitors of granulocytes
  and macrophages, and the production and maturation of dendritic cells. It stimulates
  myeloblast and monoblast differentiation, synergises with Epo in the proliferation
  of erythroid and megakaryocytic  progenitor cells, acts as an autocrine mediator
  of growth for some types of acute myeloid leukemia, is a strong chemoattractant
  for neutrophils and eosinophils. It enhances the activity of neutrophils and macrophages.
  Under steady-state conditions GM-CSF is not essential for the production of myeloid
  cells, but it is required for the proper development of alveolar macrophages, otherwise,
  pulmonary alvelolar proteinosis (PAP) develops. A growing body of evidence suggests
  that GM-CSF plays a key role in emergency hematopoiesis (predominantly myelopoiesis)  in
  response to infection, including the production of granulocytes and macrophages
  in the bone marrow and their maintenance, survival, and functional activation at
  sites of injury or insult  (Hercus et al. 2009).<br><br> All three receptors have
  alpha chains that bind their specific ligands with low affinity (de Groot et al.
  1998). Bc then associates with the alpha chain forming a high affinity receptor
  (Geijsen et al. 2001), though the in vivo receptor is likely be a higher order multimer
  as recently demonstrated for the GM-CSF receptor (Hansen et al. 2008).<br><br> The
  receptor chains lack intrinsic kinase activity, instead they interact with and activate
  signaling kinases, notably Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). These phosphorylate the common
  beta subunit, allowing recruitment of signaling molecules such as Shc, the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinases (PI3Ks), and the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs).
  The cytoplasmic domain of Bc has two distinct functional domains: the membrane proximal
  region mediates the induction of proliferation-associated genes such as c-myc, pim-1
  and oncostatin M. This region binds multiple signal-transducing proteins including
  JAK2 (Quelle et al. 1994), STATs, c-Src and PI3 kinase (Rao and Mufson, 1995). The
  membrane distal domain is required for cytokine-induced growth inhibition and is
  necessary for the viability of hematopoietic cells (Inhorn et al. 1995). This region
  interacts with signal-transducing proteins such as Shc (Inhorn et al. 1995) and
  SHP and mediates the transcriptional activation of c-fos, c-jun, c-Raf and p70S6K
  (Reddy et al. 2000).<br><br><br><br>Figure reproduced by permission from Macmillan

  - There are five variants of the p85 regulatory subunit, designated p85alpha, p55alpha,
    p50alpha, p85beta, and p55gamma. There are also three variants of the p110 catalytic
    subunit designated p110alpha, beta, or gamma catalytic subunit. The first three
    regulatory subunits are all splice variants of the same gene (Pik3r1), the other
    two are expressed by Pik3r2 and Pik3r3, respectively). The most highly expressed
    regulatory subunit is p85alpha.  All three catalytic subunits are expressed by
    separate genes (Pik3ca, Pik3cb, and Pik3cd for p110alpha, p110beta and p110gamma,
    respectively). The alpha and beta p110s are expressed in all cells, while p110gamma
    is expressed primarily in leukocytes. It has been suggested that it evolved in
    parallel with the adaptive immune system. The regulatory p101 and catalytic p110gamma
    subunits comprise the class IB PI3Ks, each is encoded by a single gene.
