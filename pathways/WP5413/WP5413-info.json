    "description": "Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is a pleiotropic immunoregulatory cytokine belonging to the family of IL-10 cytokine. IL-24 is the only member of the IL-10 cytokine family with tumor-suppressing, anti-angiogenic, and metastasis-inhibiting properties. The activation of IL-24 induces complex downstream signaling pathways that culminate in anti-tumor activities. This dual functional cytokine is known to induce tumor suppressive activity in various cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), melanoma, lung, breast, pancreatic, hepatocellular, colorectal, and cervical cancer. Furthermore, the activation of IL-24 leads to the modulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, as well as promotes immune defense against infections. Because of its multifaceted anti-tumor and immuno-regulating properties, IL-24 can be a potential therapeutic intervention for a wide range of pathophysiological conditions.   ",
