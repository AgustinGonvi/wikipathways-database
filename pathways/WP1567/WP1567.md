description: 'Glycolysis is the process of converting glucose into pyruvate and generating
  small amounts of ATP (energy) and NADH (reducing power). It is a central pathway
  that produces important precursor metabolites: six-carbon compounds of glucose-6P
  and fructose-6P and three-carbon compounds of glycerone-P, glyceraldehyde-3P, glycerate-3P,
  phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate [MD:M00001]. Acetyl-CoA, another important precursor
  metabolite, is produced by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate [MD:M00679]. When
  the enzyme genes of this pathway are examined in completely sequenced genomes, the
  reaction steps of three-carbon compounds from glycerone-P to pyruvate form a conserved
  core module [MD:M00002], which is found in almost all organisms and which often
  corresponds to operon structures in bacterial genomes. Gluconeogenesis is a synthesis
  pathway of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors. It is essentially a reversal
  of glycolysis with minor variations of alternative paths [MD:M00003].  Source: KEGG
