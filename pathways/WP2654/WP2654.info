description: During prophase, the chromatin in the nucleus condenses, and the nucleolus disappears.  Centrioles begin moving to the opposite poles or sides of the cell. Some of the fibers that extend from the centromeres cross the cell to form the mitotic spindle.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=68875 Reactome].
