description: Schematic of predicted interactions of miR-124 with cell cycle and cell
  differentiation machinery.  A genomewide miRNA mimic toxicity screen indicates common
  and selective vulnerabilities of epithelial ovarian cancer cells. miR-124 is selectively
  toxic, mainly by inducing terminal cell differentiation via its target SIX4.
