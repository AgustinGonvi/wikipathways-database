Description: Schematic of predicted interactions of miR-124 with cell cycle and cell differentiation machinery.  A genomewide miRNA mimic toxicity screen indicates common and selective vulnerabilities of epithelial ovarian cancer cells. miR-124 is selectively toxic, mainly by inducing terminal cell differentiation via its target SIX4.
