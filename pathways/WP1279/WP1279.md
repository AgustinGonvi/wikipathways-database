description: 'Estrogen receptor refers to a group of receptors which are activated
  by the hormone 17&amp;amp;amp;#x3b2;-estradiol (estrogen). Two types of estrogen
  receptor exist: ER which is a member of the nuclear hormone family of intracellular
  receptors and the estrogen G protein coupled receptor GPR30 (GPER), which is a G-protein
  coupled receptor. The main function of the estrogen receptor is as a DNA binding
  transcription factor which regulates gene expression. However the estrogen receptor
  also has additional functions independent of DNA binding.'
