description: 'This pathway describes imbalances in RAS and Bradykinin pathways in
  COVID-19.  The expression of several genes in this pathway is affected in by SARS-CoV-2:   *
  SERPING1 is downregulated, which cancels the suppression of F12 of the intrinsic
  coagulation cascade, resulting in the production of bradykinin from kallikrein and
  KNG. * ACE is downregulated, which increases bradykinin levels. * ACE2 is upregulated,
  ACE is downregulated, which causes an increase in Angiotensin 1-9 and sensitization
  of bradykinin receptors. * NFkappaB is suppressed by SARS-Cov-2, decreasing its
  binding to the ACE promoter and subsequent transcription.  The result of a hyperactive
  bradykinin system is vasodilation to the point of vascular leakage and infiltration
  of inflammatory cells.  The pathway is based on figure 2A from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7410499/
  Garvin et al.]'
