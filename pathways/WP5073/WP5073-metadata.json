  "description": "The Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Delta forms a complex with the transcription factor BCL6, which prevents BCL6 from repressing proinflammatory cytokine genes. When a ligand binds to PPARD, the complex separates. PPARD can form a complex with NFkB or with RXRs to have varying effects.This pathway is based on the entry on the PPARG pathway on Nuclear Receptor Resource (https://nrresource.org/nuclear_receptors/peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-delta-ppard-nr1c2/).",
