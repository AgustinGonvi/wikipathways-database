description: Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson
  classification. Type 1 of this classification is linked to a decrease of LPL, either
  through mutations on the gene itself or because of other factors. LPL hydrolyzed
  triglycerides in chylomicrons and in very low-density lipoproteins. Type 1 familial
  hyperlipidemia shows an increase of chylomicrons. LPL normally hydrolizes these
  chylomicrons into chylomicron remnants. However, mutations in LPL have been shown
  to be the cause of the first form of type 1 hyperlipidemia. In tissue, LMF1 causes
  proper folding and assembly of LPL, which is stabalized by Sel1L. LPL is then transported
  to the endothelial cell surface of the capillary lumen, where it binds to GPIHBP1.
  APOC2 is essential for LPL activation, which is stabalized by APOA5. Studies have
  found another form of LPL activity, but with an increased amount of LPL inhibitors.
  These inhibitors are ANGPTL3,4 and 8. Which of these are inhibiting LPL depends
  on the tissue the LPL is in.
