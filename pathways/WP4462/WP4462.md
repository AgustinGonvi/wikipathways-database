description: This pathway describes platelet-mediated interactions with vascular or
  circulating cells. It is adapted from figure 2 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348254
  Koupenova et al], in collaboration with Dr. Milka Koupenova.   Platelets interact
  with endothelial and immune cells in the circulation, and control the response to
  microbes, inflammatory stimuli, and vessel damage.  Through their TLRs or inflammatory
  signals, platelets can change their surface expression and release their granule
  content and in that way interact with different immune cells. Platelets form heterotypic
  aggregates with other immune cells and initiate innate immune responses in the presence
  of TLR agonists and viruses (encephalomyocarditis virus, coxsackievirus B, dengue,
  flu and HIV).  Platelets can also interact with dendritic cells through P-selectin,
  and activate them to become antigen-presenting through their CD154.  Platelets engage
  the adaptive immune response by releasing their granule content which leads to IgG
  production and control of T-cell function.  Similarly, platelets are able to activate
  the endothelium, make it more permeable, and mediate leukocyte trafficking to the
  inflamed endothelium.   Description is adapted from Koupenova et al.
