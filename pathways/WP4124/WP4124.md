description: 'Cilia are membrane covered organelles that extend from the surface of
  eukaryotic cells. Cilia may be motile, such as respiratory cilia) or non-motile
  (such as the primary cilium) and are distinguished by the structure of their microtubule-based
  axonemes. The axoneme consists of nine peripheral doublet microtubules, and in the
  case of many motile cilia, may also contain a pair of central single microtubules.
  These are referred to as 9+0 or 9+2 axonemes, respectively. Relative to their non-motile
  counterparts, motile cilia also contain additional structures that contribute to
  motion, including inner and outer dynein arms, radial spokes and nexin links. Four
  main types of cilia have been identified in humans: 9+2 motile (such as respiratory
  cilia), 9+0 motile (nodal cilia), 9+2 non-motile (kinocilium of hair cells) and
  9+0 non-motile (primary cilium and photoreceptor cells)  (reviewed in Fliegauf et
  al, 2007).  This pathway describes cilia formation, with an emphasis on the primary
  cilium. The primary cilium is a sensory organelle that is required for the transduction
  of numerous external signals such as growth factors, hormones and morphogens, and
  an intact primary cilium is needed for signaling pathways mediated by Hh, WNT, calcium,
  G-protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, among others (reviewed
  in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Berbari et al, 2009; Nachury, 2014). Unlike the motile
  cilia, which are generally present in large numbers on epithelial cells and are
  responsible for sensory function as well as wave-like beating motions, the primary
  cilium is a non-motile sensory organelle that is present in a single copy at the
  apical surface of most quiescent cells (reviewed in Hsiao et al, 2012).   Cilium
  biogenesis involves the anchoring of the basal body, a centriole-derived organelle,
  near the plasma membrane and the subsequent polymerization of the microtubule-based
  axoneme and extension of the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ishikawa and Marshall,
  2011; Reiter et al, 2012). Although the ciliary membrane is continuous with the
  plasma membrane, the protein and lipid content of the cilium and the ciliary membrane
  are distinct from those of the bulk cytoplasm and plasma membrane (reviewed in Emmer
  et al, 2010; Rohatgi and Snell, 2010). This specialized compartment is established
  and maintained during cilium biogenesis by the formation of a ciliary transition
  zone, a proteinaceous structure that, with the transition fibres, anchors the basal
  body to the plasma membrane and acts as a ciliary pore to limit free diffusion from
  the cytosol to the cilium (reviewed in Nachury et al, 2010; Reiter et al, 2012).
  Ciliary components are targeted from the secretory system to the ciliary base and
  subsequently transported to the ciliary tip, where extension of the axoneme occurs,
  by a motor-driven process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). Anterograde transport
  of cargo from the ciliary base to the tip of the cilium requires kinesin-2 type
  motors, while the dynein-2 motor is required for retrograde transport back to the
  ciliary base.  In addition, both anterograde and retrograde transport depend on
  the IFT complex, a multiprotein assembly consisting of two subcomplexes, IFT A and
  IFT B. The primary cilium is a dynamic structure that undergoes continuous steady-state
  turnover of tubulin at the tip; as a consequence, the IFT machinery is required
  for cilium maintenance as well as biogenesis (reviewed in Bhogaraju et al, 2013;
  Hsiao et al, 2012; Li et al, 2012; Taschner et al, 2012; Sung and Leroux, 2013).   The
  importance of the cilium in signaling and cell biology is highlighted by the wide
  range of defects and disorders, collectively known as ciliopathies, that arise as
  the result of mutations in genes encoding components of the ciliary machinery (reviewed
  in Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Madhivanan and Aguilar, 2014).  View original pathway
