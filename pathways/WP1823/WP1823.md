description: The platelet GPIb complex (GP1b-IX-V) together with GPVI are primarily
  responsible for regulating the initial adhesion of platelets to the damaged blood
  vessel and platelet activation. The importance of GPIb is demonstrated by the bleeding
  problems in patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome where this receptor is either
  absent or defective. GP1b-IX-V binds von Willebrand Factor (vWF) to resting platelets,
  particularly under conditions of high shear stress. This transient interaction is
  the first stage of the vascular repair process. Activation of GP1b-IX-V on exposure
  of the fibrous matrix following atherosclerotic plaque rupture, or in occluded arteries,
  is a major contributory factor leading to thrombus formation leading to heart attack
  or stroke. GpIb also binds thrombin (Yamamoto et al. 1986), at a site distinct from
  the site of vWF binding, acting as a docking site for thrombin which then activates
  Proteinase Activated Receptors leading to enhanced platelet activation (Dormann
  et al. 2000).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=430116
