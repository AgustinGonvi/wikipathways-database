description: This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Sterol lipids expended pathway
  display [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php] and extended with
  Scheme 1 from Acimovic et al (2013 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23558541]).
  Literature suggests that cholesterol synthesis preferentially starts with the Bloch
  pathway, however there is a shift to the Kandutsch-Russell part via lathosterol
  (Bae et al, 1997[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9291139]).  Dashed lines indicate
  that multiple steps are involved to create the final product. Several regulatory
  effects concerning the metabolites of cholesterol have been indicated as well. The
  content from the Bloch and Kandutsch-Russel pathways have been checked against literature,
  and differences compared to the original LipidMaps pathway have been coloured turquoise.
