description: 'The Transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x3b2;) signaling pathway is
  involved in many cellular processes in both the adult organism and the developing
  embryo including cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cellular homeostasis
  and other cellular functions. In spite of the wide range of cellular processes that
  the TGF&#x3b2; signaling pathway regulates, the process is relatively simple. TGF&#x3b2;
  superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates
  a type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs
  (R-SMADs) which can now bind the coSMAD SMAD4. R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate
  in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation
  of target gene expression. (source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGF_beta_signaling_pathway
