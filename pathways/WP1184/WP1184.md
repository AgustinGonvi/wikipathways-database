description: 'Nuclear receptors are a class of proteins found within the interior
  of cells that are responsible for sensing the presence of steroid and thyroid hormones
  and certain other molecules. In response, these receptors work in concert with other
  proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes thereby controlling the development,
  homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism. Nuclear receptors have the ability
  to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these
  receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression
  by nuclear receptors only happens when a liganda molecule which affects the receptor''s
  behavioris present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results
  in a conformational change in the receptor which in turn activates the receptor
  resulting in up-regulation of gene expression. A unique property of nuclear receptors
  which differentiate them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly
  interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. Consequently nuclear receptors
  play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Source: Wikipedia
