description: Vitamin B12 is a water soluble, organic compound and essential nutrient
  involved in the everyday functioning of the nervous system and the brain.   Vitamin
  B12 is involved in the preservation and regeneration of the myelin shealth - the
  protective fatty layer that acts as an insulator in nerve axons.  Animals store
  vitamin B12 in liver and muscle and therefore eggs, milk, meat, liver are sources
  of the vitamin.  Problems in metabolism of vitamin B12 lead to "persistent" lack
  of energy to perform every day tasks.   The genes and pathways highlighted above
  describe several routes through which genes and metabolites involved in B12 metabolism
  are interconnected.  Central B12 metabolism nodes include folate metabolism and
  the synthesis of the citric acid cycle intermediates and succinyl-CoA, cyanocobalamin
  into methylcobalamin conversion, tyrosine nitration and riboflavin pathways.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1533
  CPTAC Assay Portal].
