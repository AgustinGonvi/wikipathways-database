description: 'RUNX2 (CBFA1 or AML3) transcription factor, similar to other RUNX family
  members, RUNX1 and RUNX3, can function in complex with CBFB (CBF-beta) (Kundu et
  al. 2002, Yoshida et al. 2002, Otto et al. 2002). RUNX2 mainly regulates transcription
  of genes involved in skeletal development (reviewed in Karsenty 2008). RUNX2 is
  involved in development of both intramembraneous and endochondral bones through
  regulation of osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, respectively.
  RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the BGLAP gene (Ducy and Karsenty 1995, Ducy et
  al. 1997), which encodes Osteocalcin, a bone-derived hormone which is one of the
  most abundant non-collagenous proteins of the bone extracellular matrix (reviewed
  in Karsenty and Olson 2016). RUNX2 directly controls the expression of most genes
  associated with osteoblast differentiation and function (Sato et al. 1998, Ducy
  et al. 1999, Roce et al. 2005). RUNX2-mediated transcriptional regulation of several
  genes involved in GPCR (G protein coupled receptor) signaling is implicated in the
  control of growth of osteoblast progenitors (Teplyuk et al. 2009). RUNX2 promotes
  chondrocyte maturation by stimulating transcription of the IHH gene, encoding Indian
  hedgehog (Takeda et al. 2001, Yoshida et al. 2004). Germline loss-of-function mutations
  of the RUNX2 gene are associated with cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome (CCD), an
  autosomal skeletal disorder (reviewed in Jaruga et al. 2016). The function of RUNX2
  is frequently disrupted in osteosarcoma (reviewed in Mortus et al. 2014). Vitamin
  D3 is implicated in regulation of transcriptional activity of the RUNX2:CBFB complex
  (Underwood et al. 2012).<p>RUNX2 expression is regulated by estrogen signaling,
  and RUNX2 is implicated in breast cancer development and metastasis (reviewed in
  Wysokinski et al. 2014). Besides estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and estrogen-related
  receptor alpha (ERRA) (Kammerer et al. 2013), RUNX2 transcription is also regulated
  by TWIST1 (Yang, Yang et al. 2011), glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) (Zhang et al.
  2012), NKX3-2 (BAPX1) (Tribioli and Lufkin 1999, Lengner et al. 2005), DLX5 (Robledo
  et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2005) and MSX2 (Lee et al. 2005). RUNX2 can autoregulate,
  by directly inhibiting its own transcription (Drissi et al. 2000). Several E3 ubiquitin
  ligases target RUNX2 for proteasome-mediated degradation: FBXW7a (Kumar et al. 2015),
  STUB1 (CHIP) (Li et al. 2008), SMURF1 (Zhao et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2014), WWP1
  (Jones et al. 2006), and SKP2 (Thacker et al. 2016). Besides formation of RUNX2:CBFB
  heterodimers, transcriptional activity of RUNX2 is regulated by binding to a number
  of other transcription factors, for example SOX9 (Zhou et al. 2006, TWIST1 (Bialek
  et al. 2004) and RB1 (Thomas et al. 2001).<p>RUNX2 regulates expression of several
  genes implicated in cell migration during normal development and bone metastasis
  of breast cancer cells. RUNX2 stimulates transcription of the ITGA5 gene, encoding
  Integrin alpha 5 (Li et al. 2016) and the ITGBL1 gene, encoding Integrin beta like
  protein 1 (Li et al. 2015). RUNX2 mediated transcription of the MMP13 gene, encoding
  Colagenase 3 (Matrix metalloproteinase 13), is stimulated by AKT mediated phosphorylation
  of RUNX2 (Pande et al. 2013). RUNX2 is implicated in positive regulation of AKT
  signaling by stimulating expression of AKT-activating TORC2 complex components MTOR
  and RICTOR, which may contribute to survival of breast cancer cells (Tandon et al.
  2014).<p>RUNX2 inhibits CDKN1A transcription, thus preventing CDKN1A-induced cell
  cycle arrest. Phosphorylation of RUNX2 by CDK4 in response to high glucose enhances
  RUNX2-mediated repression of the CDKN1A gene in endothelial cells (Pierce et al.
  2012). In mice, Runx2-mediated repression of Cdkn1a may contribute to the development
  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Kuo et al. 2009). RUNX2 can stimulate transcription
  of the LGALS3 gene, encoding Galectin-3 (Vladimirova et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009).
  Galectin 3 is expressed in myeloid progenitors and its levels increase during the
  maturation process (Le Marer 2000).<p>For a review of RUNX2 function, please refer
