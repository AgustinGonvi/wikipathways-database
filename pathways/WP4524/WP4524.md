description: 'The development of sexual organs in humans is still not completely understood
  at the molecular level, controlled through the chromosomal difference between men
  and women. Steroids related to sexual development can have a temporary or permanent
  effects. Androgens are the leading compounds differentiating between (among other
  sexual organs) the internal and external genitalia of men. Next to the classical
  pathway of androgen synthesis (see [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4523]),
  alternative pathways are known, which make use of either selective expression patterns
  of isoenzymes or alternate enzymes. As an alternative, a socalled ''backdoor pathway'',
  which can create dihydrotestosterone (DHT), skipping testosterone. Several enzymes
  between the classical and backdoor pathway are shared, however the later one utilises
  one unique enzyme, 3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (gene: AKR1C2). Even though
  the relevance of this backdoor pathway for humans is not completely clear yet, mutations
  in the human AKR1C2 gene can lead to disordered sexual differentiation. This finding
  would indicate that both the classical and the alternative pathway are needed for
  normal development of male genitalia in humans. For more information on androgens,
  see Hiort (2013 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23800242]), and for more information
  on the disease linked to this pathway, please visit Chapter 37 of the book of Blau
  (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).'
