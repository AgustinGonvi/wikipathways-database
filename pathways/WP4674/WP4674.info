Description: HNSCC, which includes malignant squamous lesions arising in the oral cavity, larynx and pharynx, is the seventh most common cancer in the world. HNSCC has a remarkable multiplicity and diversity of genetic alterations. Most genomic alterations in HNSCC converge in a handful of molecular pathways resulting in cell cycle deregulation, genomic instability, cell differentiation defects, and persistent mitogenic signaling, the latter involving aberrant PI3K/mTOR pathway activation thereby rendering HNSCC responsive to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.  Pathway is based on [https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4348071 Fig 1 from Iglesias-Bartolome et al], [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14129 Fig 5 from Li et al] and [https://clinicalgate.com/the-molecular-pathogenesis-of-head-and-neck-cancer/ Fig 33-3 from Clinicalgate].
