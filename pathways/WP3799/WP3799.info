description: SUMOylation of proteins involved in chromatin organization  regulates gene expression in several ways: direct influence on catalytic activity of enzymes that modify chromatin, recruitment of proteins that form repressive (e.g. PRC1) or activating complexes on chromatin, recruitment of proteins to larger bodies (e.g PML bodies) in the nucleus (reviewed in Cubenas-Potts and Matunis 2013).
