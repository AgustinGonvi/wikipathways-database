description: The farnesoid X receptor (FXR, a.k.a. NR1H4) is a nuclear receptor that
  responds to levels of bile acids present in the body and regulates many processes
  related to bile acids synthesis and transport.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2879
