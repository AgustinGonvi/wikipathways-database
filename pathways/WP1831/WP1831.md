description: 'Many hormones that affect individual physiological processes including
  the regulation of appetite, absorption, transport, and oxidation of foodstuffs influence
  energy metabolism pathways. While <b>insulin</b> mediates the storage of excess
  nutrients, <b>glucagon</b> is involved in the mobilization of energy resources in
  response to low blood glucose levels, principally by stimulating hepatic glucose
  output. Small doses of glucagon are sufficient to induce significant glucose elevations.
  These hormone-driven regulatory pathways enable the body to sense and respond to
  changed amounts of nutrients in the blood and demands for energy.<br>Glucagon and
  Insulin act through various metabolites and enzymes that target specific steps in
  metabolic pathways for sugar and fatty acids. The processes responsible for the
  long-term control of fat synthesis and short term control of glycolysis by key metabolic
  products and enzymes are annotated in this module as six specific pathways:<br><b>Pathway
  1. Glucagon signalling in metabolic pathways:</b> In response to low blood glucose,
  pancreatic alpha-cells release glucagon. The binding of glucagon to its receptor
  results in increased cAMP synthesis, and Protein Kinase A (PKA) activation.<br><b>Pathway
  2. PKA mediated phosphorylation:</b>PKA phosphorylates key enzymes, e.g., 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase
  /Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PF2K-Pase) at serine 36, and regulatory proteins,
  e.g., Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (ChREBP) at serine 196 and threonine
  666.<br>In brief, the binding of insulin to its receptor leads to increased protein
  phosphatase activity and to hydrolysis of cAMP by cAMP phosphodiesterase. These
  events counteract the regulatory effects of glucagon.<br><b>Pathway 3: Insulin stimulates
  increased synthesis of Xylulose-5-phosphate (Xy-5-P)</b>. Activation of the insulin
  receptor results indirectly in increased Xy-5-P synthesis from Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  and Fructose-6-phosphate. Xy-5-P, a metabolite of the pentose phosphate pathway,
  stimulates protein phosphatase  PP2A.<br><b>Pathway 4: AMP Kinase (AMPK) mediated
  response to high AMP:ATP ratio:</b> In response to diet with high fat content or
  low energy levels, the cytosolic AMP:ATP ratio is increased. AMP triggers a complicated  cascade
  of events. In this module we have annotated only the phosphorylation of ChREBP by
  AMPK  at serine 568, which inactivates this transcription factor.<br><b>Pathway
  5: Dephosphorylation of key metabolic factors by PP2A: </b>Xy-5-P activated PP2A
  efficiently dephosphorylates phosphorylated PF2K-Pase resulting in the higher output
  of F-2,6-P2 that enhances PFK activity in the glycolytic pathway. PP2A also dephosphorylates
  (and thus activates) cytosolic and nuclear ChREBP.<br><b>Pathway 6: Transcriptional
  activation of metabolic genes by ChREBP:</b> Dephosphorylated ChREBP activates the
  transcription of genes involved in glucose metabolism such as pyruvate kinase, and
  lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, acyl CoA
  synthase and glycerol phosphate acyl transferase.<br> The illustration below summarizes
  this network of events. Black lines are metabolic reactions, red lines are negative
  regulatory events, and green lines are positive regulatory events (figure reused
