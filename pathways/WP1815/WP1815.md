description: Megakaryocytes (MKs) give rise to circulating platelets (thrombocytes)
  through terminal differentiation of MKs which release cytoplasmic fragments as circulating
  platelets. As MKs mature they undergo endoreduplication (polyploidisation) and expansion
  of cytoplasmic mass to cell sizes larger than 50-100 microns, and ploidy ranges
  up to 128 N. As MKs mature, the polyploid nucleus becomes horseshoe-shaped, the
  cytoplasm expands, and platelet organelles and the demarcation membrane system are
  amplified. Proplatelet projections form which give rise to de novo circulating platelets
  (Deutsch & Tomer 2006).  <br>The processes of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet
  production occur within a complex microenvironment where chemokines, cytokines and
  adhesive interactions play major roles (Avecilla et al. 2004). Megakaryocytopoiesis
  is regulated at several levels including proliferation, differentiation and platelet
  release (Kaushansky 2003). Thrombopoietin (TPO/c-Mpl ligand) is the most potent
  cytokine stimulating proliferation and maturation of MK progenitors (Kaushansky
  2005) but many other growth factors are involved. MK development is controlled by
  the action of multiple transcription factors. Many MK-specific genes are co-regulated
  by GATA and friend of GATA (FOG), RUNX1 and ETS proteins. Nuclear factor erythroid
  2 (NF-E2), which has an MK-erythroid specific 45-kDa subunit, controls terminal
  MK maturation, proplatelet formation and platelet release (Schulze & Shivdasani
  2004). NF-E2 deficient mice have profound thrombocytopenia (Shiraga et al. 1999).
  MYB (c-myb) functions with EP300 (p300) as a negative regulator of thrombopoiesis
  (Metcalf et al. 2005). During MK maturation, internal membrane systems, granules
  and organelles are assembled. Cytoplasmic fragmentation requires changes in the
  MK cytoskeleton and formation of organelles and channels. Individual organelles
  migrate from the cell body to the proplatelet ends, with approximately 30 percent
  of organelles/granules in motion at any given time (Richardson et al. 2005).  View
