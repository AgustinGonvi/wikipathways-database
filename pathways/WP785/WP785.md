description: 'Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental
  processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the
  control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There
  are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell
  polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the
  major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic
  beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin
  is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction
  with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment
  of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of
  the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate
  the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing
  protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell
  adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2+ signalling is mediated through G proteins and phospholipases
  and leads to transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium that subsequently activate
  the kinase PKC (protein kinase C) and CAMKII (calcium calmodulin mediated kinase
  II) and the phosphatase calcineurin.  Source: [http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa04310.html
