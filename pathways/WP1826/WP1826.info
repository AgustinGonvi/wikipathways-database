description: The GPVI receptor is a complex of the GPVI protein with Fc epsilon R1 gamma (FcR). The Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn constitutively associate with the GPVI-FcR complex in platelets and initiate platelet activation through phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in the FcR gamma chain, leading to binding and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk. Downstream of Syk, a series of adapter molecules and effectors lead to platelet activation. <br><br>The GPVI receptor signaling cascade is similar to that of T- and B-cell immune receptors, involving the formation of a signalosome composed of adapter and effector proteins. At the core of the T-cell receptor signalosome is the transmembrane adapter LAT and two cytosolic adapters SLP-76 and Gads. While LAT is essential for signalling to PLCgamma1 downstream of the T-cell receptor, the absence of LAT in platelets only impairs the activation of PLCgamma2, the response to collagen and GPVI receptor ligands remains sufficient to elicit a full aggregation response. In contrast, GPVI signalling is almost entirely abolished in the absence of SLP-76.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=114604 Reactome].
