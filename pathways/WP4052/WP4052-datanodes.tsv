2xIL12B	Complex	R-HSA-8950640	Reactome	Homodimeric protein of Interleukin-12 beta subunit (IL12B or IL12p40) can be secreted to exert its inhibitory function over Interleukin-12 heterodimer interleukin-12 receptor interaction. The secretion has been shown experimentally in COS cells and by mean of ELISA assays (PMID: 7527811).

p-JAK1 	Protein	P23458	Uniprot-TrEMBL	The receptor chains are also utilized by multiple cytokines (Fig. 1)1,2. IL-12 signals via IL12RÎ²1 and IL12RÎ²248,71,72, while IL-23 signals through IL12RÎ²1 and IL23R69,73. In contrast, IL-27 utilizes gp130 and WSX-174, while IL-35 signals via gp130 and IL12RÎ²228. IL-35 is unusual in that it can also signals via two additional receptor chain compositions; gp130-gp130 and IL12RÎ²2-lL12RÎ²2 homodimers28.<br>Signaling via all of these receptors is mediated by members of the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) family27,75,76 (Fig. 1). JAK2 and either JAK1 or TYK2 appear to mediate phosphorylation of the IL-12 cytokine receptors family-associated STATs. IL-12 mediates signaling via pSTAT477, IL-23 via pSTAT3 and pSTAT469,73, IL-27 via pSTAT1 and pSTAT378,79, and IL-35 via pSTAT1 and pSTAT428. For IL-35, formation of a STAT1:STAT4 heterodimer is required for Ebi2/ Il12a transcription, but partially dispensable for supression28 (PMID:22814351)

IL12RB1:TYK2	Complex	R-HSA-8950046	Reactome	The intracellular domain of human Interleukin-12 receptor subunit beta-1 (IL12RB1) but not the intracellular domain of Interleukin-12 receptor subunit beta-2 (IL12RB2) interacts directly with Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase (TYK2) (Zou et al. 1997)<br>Inferred from mouse:<br>TYK2 associates with IL12RB1. In the absence of TYK2, IL12RB1 can associate with Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK1 (JAK1) (Floss et al. 2016).

CANX:EBI3	Complex	R-HSA-8950369	Reactome	Calnexin (CANX or p95 calnexin) binds Interleukin-27 subunit beta (EBI3, IL27B). In human cell lines (BL30, BL41, Louckes, BJAB, P3HR1) most newly synthesized EBI3 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in an endoglycosidase H-sensitive form (Devergne et al. 1996, 1997), bound to CANX and a 60-kDa protein and transiently with a p75-kDa protein, both ignored here). EBI3 can be released by itself but the association with CANX prevents this, the complex is retained in the ER. The co-expression of other interleukin subunits enables the release of EBI3 in a complex with Interleukin-27 subunit alpha (IL27) (Devergne et al. 1996).

IL12A:IL12B	Complex	R-HSA-8950122	Reactome	The Interleukin-12 heterodimer (IL-12) is formed by Interleukin-12 subunit alpha (IL12A, IL-12p35) and Interleukin-12 subunit beta (IL12B, IL-12p40) (Podlaski et al. 1992, Kobayashi et al. 1989, Stern et al.1990). Heterodimerization occurs due to charged residue interactions (Yoon et al. 2000) and is stabilized by disulfide bounding. <br>IL12 heterodimerization is believed to occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) because inhibition of the enzyme Prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit beta (P4HB), referred to in this article as Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), by bacitracin causes IL-12 retention in the ER (Alloza & Vandenbroek 2005).

IL12RB2:JAK2	Complex	R-HSA-8950039	Reactome	Inferred from mouse and muse-human protein interaction:   There is experimental evidence that show that murine protein Tyrosin kinase Jak2(Jak2) (PMID: 9001223) associates with IL-12Rbeta2 (Interleukin-12 recetor subunit beta 2) directly and IL-12Rbeta1(Interleukin-12 recetor subunit beta 1) and Tyk2(Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase TYK2) are not required for the association between IL-12Rbeta2 and Jak2.  (PMID:27193299)Stimulation with rhIL-12(recombinant human Interleukin-12) didnâ€™t alter the association between IL-12Rbeta2 and Jak2  in COS 7 cells expressing IL-12Rbeta2, IL-12Rbeta1, Jak2 and Tyk2 (PMID:10198225) In conclusion the amino-terminus of Jak2 is necessary for association with IL-12Rbeta2. Thus Jak2 binds to the cytoplasmatic membrane-proximal region of IL-12Rbeta2, and box2 motif and tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain are not required for binding (PMID:10198225)

Binding of p19 to p40 is mediated primarily by an arginine residue on helix D of p19 that forms an extensive charge and hydrogen-bonding netwrok with residues at the base of a pocket on p40.

IL12RB1:TYK2:IL12RB2:JAK2	Complex	R-HSA-8950052	Reactome	Experimental evidence shows that human IL-12Rbeta2, similar to human IL12Rbeta1, appears to exist at the cell surface as a disulfide bonded dimer/oligomer. Formation of this human Interleukin-12Rbeta2 oligomer is not dependent on Interleukin-12 binding, since it was observed in cells that were never exposed to Interleukin-12 heterodimeric protein.<br>Interleukin-12 receptor beta1 does not contain any cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, whereas the cytoplasmic region of Interleulin-12 receptor beta2 contains three tyrosine residues. This last has an important role for the beta 2 subunit in Interleukin-12 signal transduction (PMID: 8943050). Based on (Kotenko et. al., 1996, PMID: 8663414) signal transduction receptor chains can be divided into two classes. IL12RB2  would be of the first class : signal transducers (ST) with STAT (or SH2 domain-containg proteins) recruitment sites (SRS) and Jak association sites (JAS) . Whereas IL12RB1 would be the the second class:  helper receptors (HR)  containg only JAS and no SRS (PMID:27193299 )

Secretion of IL27 was observed in HEK 293 cells transfected with IL27 cDNA in the absence of CRLF1. This may indicate that formation of a complex is not strictly required for IL27 secretion in these cells. Alternatively it could reflect the formation of a complex between IL27 and endogenous CRLF1, which is expressed in HEK 293 cells. The IL27:CRLF1 complex is biologically active (CrabÃ© et al. 2009).<br><br>This reaction is a black box event because the mechanism of translocation is unknown.

Several cytokine receptors activate STAT1 and STAT4 to drive proinflammatory T helper 1 type responses, so it is unclear how their activation via the interleukin-35 receptor gives rise to a unique STAT dimer.  <br>T cells stimulated with Interleukin-12 plus IFN-gamma (IFNG) induce minimal interaction of a STAT1:STAT4 with consensus STAT-binding sites in the IL12A and EBI3 promoters. However, T cells stimulated with Interleukin-35 showed considerable enrichment for the binding of STAT1 and STAT4 to IL12A position 250 and EBI3 position 500, as well as other sites in their promoters. <br>This reaction is presented as a black box because the exact mechanism of traslocation to the nucleus is unclear.

IL27:EBI3:IL27RA:JAK1:IL6ST:JAK1,JAK2,(TYK2)	Complex	R-HSA-448431	Reactome	Interleukin-27 (IL27)  is an heterodimer composed by (IL27) and (EBI3). It binds to Interleukin-27 heterodimer, formed by Interleukin-27 receptor subunit alpha (IL27RA) and Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST or gp130). Also in absence of IL27RA it can binds to the Interleukin-6 receptor subunit (IL6ST or gp130) but with lower affinity than to IL27 receptor heterodimer (PMID: 27119567)

IL12A:EBI3	Complex	R-HSA-8950589	Reactome	Interleukin-35 is a heterodimer of Interleukin-27 subunit beta (EBI3) and Interleukin-12 subunit alpha (IL12A or IL12-p35) (Devergne et al. 1997). It is required for maximal T regulatory cell activity (Collison et al. 2007).<br>Site directed mutagenesis of IL12A identified mutations that disrupt formation of Interleukin 12 and Interleukin 27 heterodimeric complexes but not Interleukin 35. IL12A appears to pair with EBI3 entirely differently from IL27. (Jones et al. 2012). In the absence of IL12A, EBI3 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, associated with the chaperone Calnexin (CANX) (Devergne et al. 1997).<br>This is a Black Box event because we know that EBI3 is retained as a complex with CANX and the co expression of EBI3 and IL12A enables their secretion, but we don't have evidence about the mechanism of dissociation of CANX from EBI3 (Devergne et al. 1997).<br><br>
