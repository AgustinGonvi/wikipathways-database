description: The active forms of niacin (a term for nicotinate and nicotinamide) are
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its 2'-phosphate ester (NADP), which
  are coenzymes in hundreds of redox reactions.  NAD is also the substrate for sirtuins,
  poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases, and other enzymes that release the nicotinamide moiety.  The
  de novo synthesis pathway begins in the plastid, where nicotinate mononucleotide
  (NaMN) is formed from aspartate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and a ribose phosphate
  moiety. NaMN then exits to the cytosol, where successive adenylation and amidation
  give nicotinate adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) and then NAD (Noctor et al., 2011).
  The adenylation, and likely amidation, steps also occur in mitochondria (Di Martino
  and Pallotta, 2011). NAD is converted to NADP in cytosol, plastids, peroxisomes,
  and probably mitochondria (Di Martino and Pallotta, 2011; Noctor et al., 2011).
  The nicotinamide released by NAD-consuming enzymes is salvaged by hydrolysis to
  nicotinate, which is converted to NaMN that re-enters the de novo pathway. NAD is
  cleaved by various enzymes to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which can be reconverted
  directly to NAD or hydrolysed to nicotinamide and recycled as above. These salvage
  reactions are all cytosolic; the NMN -> NAD reaction is also likely mitochondrial
  (Di Martino and Pallotta, 2011; Noctor et al., 2011).
