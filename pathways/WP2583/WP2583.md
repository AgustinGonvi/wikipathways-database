description: The activation and translocation of transcription factors NFAT, AP-1
  and NF-kappa-B via the co-stimulatory signaling cascade triggered by MHC peptide,
  B7 proteins and PD-L1. The activation of NFAT involves a Ca2+/calcineurin disruption
  of a massive RNA-protein complex prior to its translocation into the nucleus and
  ultimate transcription factor activity.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2583
  CPTAC Assay Portal].

  - PLC-g ultimately produces 3 different second messangers to activate 3 paths leading
    to different TFs that lead to IL-2 transcription
  - B7-1/ B7-2
  - CTLA4
  - SHP1
  - GSK3B
  - SHP is recruited to the PD-1 cytoplasmic tail when PD-1 ITIMs are phosphorylated.

  - CTLA-4 interfers with the formation of lipid rafts, TCR:ZAP70 microclusters, and
    central supramolecular activation complex.
  - This scaffold includes LAT, SLP-76, Grb2, SOS, GADS
  - Ras-GAP
  - Function is controlled largely by regulation of its surface expression. Initially
    CTLA-4 is in the intracellular membrane but moves to the cell surface after T-cell
    receptor signaling.
  - When CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail is NOT phosphorylated it binds to AP-2 (clathrin
    adapter molecule) and is removed from the surface. When the tail is phosphorylated
    AP-2 cannot bind and CTLA-4 is expressed on the surface.
  - PDCD1
  - LcK is activated when the extracellular part of CD8 binds its (MHC:peptide) ligand.
    Lck is a Src family kinase that is constitutively expressed. It phosphorylates
    all TCR ITAMS.
  - AKT1
  - TCRB
  - It docks at the TCR (requires both ITAM positions to be phosphorylated), is then
    phosphorylated by Lck, and then recruits other signaling proteins.
  - PLCG1
  - 'DAG is a membrane protein which can now recruit other signaling molecules to
    the membrane by serving as a binding target. '
  - Calcineurin
  - ZAP70
  - PI3K can also bind ICOS
  - PTEN
  - DYRK2
  - CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for B7 ligand, and it has a higher affinity of B7 in
    part because CTLA-4 binds B7 in a dimer.
  - CSNK1A1
  - PIP3
  - PLC-g is initially brought to the plasma membrane by binding of its PH domain
    to membrane lipid PIP3. PLC-g then binds to LAT and SLP-76 and can be activated
    by Itk mediated phosphorylation.
  - CD8A
  - CD8B
  - NFKB1
  - Ras-GTP
  - PIP2
  - PD-L1
  - MHC peptide
  - Basically, Lck is bound to CD8. When CD8 binds MHC:peptide, Lck gets activated
    and can phosphorylate nearby ITAMs.
  - Ca2+
  - IP3
  - TCRA
  - CD28
  - IL2
  - Ras-GDP
  - PDK1
  - DYRK1A
  - Rephosphorylation of this carboxyl-terminal tyrosine by Csk returns Lck to the
    inactive state.
  - DAG
  - NFAT1
  - IP3 is a second messanger that diffuses into the cytosol and binds to IP3 receptors
    on the ER therey opening calcium channels.
  - LAT / SLP-76 scaffold complex
  - IKK complex
  - Akt is recruited to the membrane by PIP3. Here Akt can be activated / phosphorylated
    (indirectly) by P13K and can then phosphorylate a variety of downstream pathways.
    Noteably, Akt promotes cell survival by inhibiting the cell death pathway and
    stimulates cell metabolism by increasing the utilization of glucose.
