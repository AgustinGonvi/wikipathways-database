LCK	GeneProduct	3932	Entrez Gene	Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase - Lck in its inactive state is bound to CD4/CD8 cytoplasmic tail and it's terminal tyrosine is phosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of this amino acid (by tyrosine phosphotase CD45 -- CD4/CD8 binding its ligand) causes a conformations change in LcK and it becomes an active tyrosine kinase.

LcK is activated when the extracellular part of CD8 binds its (MHC:peptide) ligand. Lck is a Src family kinase that is constitutively expressed. It phosphorylates all TCR ITAMS.

Rephosphorylation of this carboxyl-terminal tyrosine by Csk returns Lck to the inactive state.

Basically, Lck is bound to CD8. When CD8 binds MHC:peptide, Lck gets activated and can phosphorylate nearby ITAMs.
ZAP70	GeneProduct	7535	Entrez Gene	ZAP-70 is kinase that becomes activated after phosphorylation. It contains to tandem SH2 domains that bind to phosphorylated ITAMs on the TCR complex cytoplasmic tails. 

It docks at the TCR (requires both ITAM positions to be phosphorylated), is then phosphorylated by Lck, and then recruits other signaling proteins.


PIP2	Metabolite	HMDB0010059	HMDB	PIP2 is a membrane lipid. 
LAT / SLP-76 scaffold complex	Protein			Linker for Activation of T cells - LAT is a transmembrane scaffold protein. It can be phosphorylated by Zap-70.

This scaffold includes LAT, SLP-76, Grb2, SOS, GADS
PIP3	Metabolite	HMDB0010147	HMDB	PIP3 is a membrane lipid generated from PIP2 by the enzyme P13K. PIP3 has a PH binding domain that can be recognized by PLC-g, Itk, and Atk.
PLCG1	GeneProduct	5335	Entrez Gene	PLC-g is a phospholipase, a class of enzymes that cleave phospholipids just before the phosphate group.

PLC-g is initially brought to the plasma membrane by binding of its PH domain to membrane lipid PIP3. PLC-g then binds to LAT and SLP-76 and can be activated by Itk mediated phosphorylation.

PLC-g ultimately produces 3 different second messangers to activate 3 paths leading to different TFs that lead to IL-2 transcription
ITK	Protein	3702	Entrez Gene	Itk is a membrane associated tryosine kinase. It binds to phosphorylated LAT and SLP-76 scafflods. From here is activates PLC-g by phosphorylation
AKT1	GeneProduct	207	Entrez Gene	Akt is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a key role in many cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription, and cell migration.

Akt is recruited to the membrane by PIP3. Here Akt can be activated / phosphorylated (indirectly) by P13K and can then phosphorylate a variety of downstream pathways. Noteably, Akt promotes cell survival by inhibiting the cell death pathway and stimulates cell metabolism by increasing the utilization of glucose.
PKC-a	GeneProduct	5578	Entrez Gene	
SHP1	GeneProduct	5777	Entrez Gene	SHP-1/2 are tyrosine phosphatases. Here, SHP removes phosphates from PIP3 reverting it back to PIP2. (reverses the work of tyrosine kinase P13K)

SHP is recruited to the PD-1 cytoplasmic tail when PD-1 ITIMs are phosphorylated.
P13K	Protein			P13K converts membrane lipid PIP2 to PIP3 by adding a phosphate. P13K activity is dependent upon CD28 co-stimulation because P13K can bind to phosphorylated ITIMs on CD28.

PI3K can also bind ICOS
Ca2+	Metabolite	HMDB0000464	HMDB	Calcium ions are second messengers, small-molecule biochemical mediators. Calcium is released from the ER by IP3.

Ras-GAP	GeneProduct	5921	Entrez Gene	Ras-GAP rapidly downregulates the activity of Ras by converting its bound GTP to GDP
Ras-GTP	Protein			Ras is a small G protein of GTPase. It is located in the membrane, and it acts as a molecular switch. It is inactive when bound to GDP, but becomes active when GDP is switched for GTP. Binding the GTP induces a conformational change in Ras thus enabling it to bind to and do other things.
DAG	Metabolite	HMDB0007223	HMDB	Produced from PIP2 cleaveage by PLC-g.

DAG is a membrane protein which can now recruit other signaling molecules to the membrane by serving as a binding target. 
IP3	Metabolite	HMDB0001059	HMDB	IP3 is generated when PLC-g cleaves PIP2.

IP3 is a second messanger that diffuses into the cytosol and binds to IP3 receptors on the ER therey opening calcium channels.
Calmodulin	Protein	801	Entrez Gene	Calmodulin is a calcium binding protein. Binding Ca ions induces a conformational change allowing calmodulin to bind to and regulate a variety of effector proteins.
RasGRP	GeneProduct	10125	Entrez Gene	RasGRP binds to DAG in the membrane where it can activate Ras

The effect of this phosphorylation activates P13K to generate PIP3 which recruits Itk to the cell membrane where Lck can phosphorylate it. Then Itk-P can recruit PLC-g
CTLA4	GeneProduct	1493	Entrez Gene	Expression is enhanced by IL-2.
Function is controlled largely by regulation of its surface expression. Initially CTLA-4 is in the intracellular membrane but moves to the cell surface after T-cell receptor signaling.
When CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail is NOT phosphorylated it binds to AP-2 (clathrin adapter molecule) and is removed from the surface. When the tail is phosphorylated AP-2 cannot bind and CTLA-4 is expressed on the surface.
CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for B7 ligand, and it has a higher affinity of B7 in part because CTLA-4 binds B7 in a dimer.
CTLA-4 interfers with the formation of lipid rafts, TCR:ZAP70 microclusters, and central supramolecular activation complex.
