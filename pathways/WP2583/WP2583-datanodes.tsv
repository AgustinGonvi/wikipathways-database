LCK	GeneProduct	ncbigene:3932	L:3932:T	Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase - Lck in its inactive state is bound to CD4/CD8 cytoplasmic tail and it's terminal tyrosine is phosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of this amino acid (by tyrosine phosphotase CD45 -- CD4/CD8 binding its ligand) causes a conformations change in LcK and it becomes an active tyrosine kinase.  LcK is activated when the extracellular part of CD8 binds its (MHC:peptide) ligand. Lck is a Src family kinase that is constitutively expressed. It phosphorylates all TCR ITAMS.  Rephosphorylation of this carboxyl-terminal tyrosine by Csk returns Lck to the inactive state.  Basically, Lck is bound to CD8. When CD8 binds MHC:peptide, Lck gets activated and can phosphorylate nearby ITAMs.							
ZAP70	GeneProduct	ncbigene:7535	L:7535:T	ZAP-70 is kinase that becomes activated after phosphorylation. It contains to tandem SH2 domains that bind to phosphorylated ITAMs on the TCR complex cytoplasmic tails.   It docks at the TCR (requires both ITAM positions to be phosphorylated), is then phosphorylated by Lck, and then recruits other signaling proteins.							
PLCG1	GeneProduct	ncbigene:5335	L:5335:T	PLC-g is a phospholipase, a class of enzymes that cleave phospholipids just before the phosphate group.  PLC-g is initially brought to the plasma membrane by binding of its PH domain to membrane lipid PIP3. PLC-g then binds to LAT and SLP-76 and can be activated by Itk mediated phosphorylation.  PLC-g ultimately produces 3 different second messangers to activate 3 paths leading to different TFs that lead to IL-2 transcription							
AKT1	GeneProduct	ncbigene:207	L:207:T	Akt is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a key role in many cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription, and cell migration.  Akt is recruited to the membrane by PIP3. Here Akt can be activated / phosphorylated (indirectly) by P13K and can then phosphorylate a variety of downstream pathways. Noteably, Akt promotes cell survival by inhibiting the cell death pathway and stimulates cell metabolism by increasing the utilization of glucose.							
PKC-a	GeneProduct	ncbigene:5578	L:5578:T								
SHP1	GeneProduct	ncbigene:5777	L:5777:T	SHP-1/2 are tyrosine phosphatases. Here, SHP removes phosphates from PIP3 reverting it back to PIP2. (reverses the work of tyrosine kinase P13K)  SHP is recruited to the PD-1 cytoplasmic tail when PD-1 ITIMs are phosphorylated.

CD28	GeneProduct	ncbigene:940	L:940:T	CD28 is a co-stimulatory surface receptor. It bind B7-1 and B7-2. After CD28 binds its ligand, it is phosphorylated by Lck. The effect of this phosphorylation activates P13K to generate PIP3 which recruits Itk to the cell membrane where Lck can phosphorylate it. Then Itk-P can recruit PLC-g							
CTLA4	GeneProduct	ncbigene:1493	L:1493:T	Expression is enhanced by IL-2. Function is controlled largely by regulation of its surface expression. Initially CTLA-4 is in the intracellular membrane but moves to the cell surface after T-cell receptor signaling. When CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail is NOT phosphorylated it binds to AP-2 (clathrin adapter molecule) and is removed from the surface. When the tail is phosphorylated AP-2 cannot bind and CTLA-4 is expressed on the surface. CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for B7 ligand, and it has a higher affinity of B7 in part because CTLA-4 binds B7 in a dimer. CTLA-4 interfers with the formation of lipid rafts, TCR:ZAP70 microclusters, and central supramolecular activation complex.							
PDCD1	GeneProduct	ncbigene:5133	L:5133:T	PD-1 is repressed by pro-inflammatry cytokines. It's ligand, PD-L1, is constitutively expressed on T-cells.
