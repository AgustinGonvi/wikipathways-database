description: This ERK pathway is implicated in Huntington's Disease. The ligands BDNF,
  EGF, and Glu bind to their respective receptors (TrkB, EGFR, mGluR) and start a
  signal transduction pathway starting with RAS and RAF1 which lead to the stimulation
  of MEK Then ERK. ERK promotes function of MSK1 (downstream kinase), ElK1 and CREB
  (Transcription Factors), and Caspases 3/7 (apoptotic molecules). These downstream
  targets are implicated in producing the effects of Huntington's Disease at the cellular
  level. This pathway is based off figure 1 from Bodai et al.  Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3853
