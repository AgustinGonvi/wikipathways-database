description: This pathway describes the induction and modulation of the apoptosis
  system during human coronavirus infection. The information is based on the review
  of Fung and Liu [10.1146/annurev-micro-020518-115759]. Apoptosis is a highly controlled
  form of cell death that can be initiated by several internal (DNA damage) and external
  factors (T-cell death signal). There are some indications that induction of apoptosis
  in immune cells contribute to the suppression of the host immune system in some
  human coronavirus infections [10.1128/JVI.00269-12]. SARS-CoV induces caspase-dependent
  apoptosis by interfering with prosurvival BCL proteins (BCL2, BCL2L1, MCL1) and
  AKT1 and uses the apoptosis induced cell deconstruction it for replication, although
  it seems not to be depending on this mechanism for replication [10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.016].
