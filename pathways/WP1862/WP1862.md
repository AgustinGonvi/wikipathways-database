description: 'After transcription, some RNA molecules are altered to contain bases
  not encoded in the genome. Most often this involves the editing or modification
  of one base to another, but in some organisms can involve the insertion or deletion
  of a base. Such editing events alter the coding properties of mRNA.<BR>RNA editing
  can be generally defined as the co- or post transcriptional modification of  the
  primary sequence of RNA from that encoded in the genome through nucleotide deletion,
  insertion, or base modification mechanisms.<BR>There are two pathways of RNA editing:  the
  substitution/conversion pathway and the insertion/deletion pathway. The  insertion/deletion
  editing occurs in protozoans like Trypanosoma, Leishmania; in slime molds like Physarum
  spp., and in some viral categories like paramyxoviruses, Ebola virus etc. To date,
  the substitution/conversion pathway has been observed in human along with other
  mammals, Drosophila, and some plants. The  RNA editing processes are known to create
  diversity in proteins involved in various pathways like lipid transport, metabolism
  etc. and may act as potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Smith et al.,
  1997).<BR>The reaction mechanisms of cytidine and adenosine deaminases is represented
  below.  In both these reactions, NH3 is presumed to be released:<BR>  View original
