description: The classical signalling mechanism for G alpha (i) is inhibition of the cAMP dependent pathway through inhibition of adenylate cyclase (Dessauer C W et al. 2002). Decreased production of cAMP from ATP results in decreased activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinases. Other functions of G alpha (i) includes activation of the protein tyrosine kinase c-Src (Ma Y C et al. 2000). Regulator of G-protein Signalling (RGS) proteins can regulate the activity of G alpha (i) (Soundararajan et al. 2008).
