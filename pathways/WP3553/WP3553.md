description: 'Derivatives of wyosine are tricyclic bases found at nucleotide 37 of
  tRNA(Phe) in eukaryotes. The pathway of wybutosine synthesis begins with a templated
  guanosine residue and proceeds through 6 steps catalyzed by 5 enzymes: N1 methylation
  of guanosine, condensation of 1-methylguanosine with pyruvate to yield 4-demethylwyosine,
  addition of an aminocarboxypropyl group to yield yW-86, methylation of yW-86 to
  yield yW-72, methylation of yW-72 to yield yW-58, and methoxycarbonylation of yW-58
  to yield wybutosine (reviewed in Young and Bandarian 2013, Perche-LetuvÃ©e et al.
  2014). Wybutosine may further be modified by hydroxylation and methylation. Wyosine
  derivatives at position 37 of tRNAs participate in translational fidelity by stabilizing
  codon-anticodon pairing (Konevega et al. 2004) and preventing frameshifting (Waas
  et al. 2007).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6782861
