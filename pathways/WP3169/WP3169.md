description: '"BMP signals are mediated by type I and II BMP receptors and their downstream
  molecules Smad1, 5 and 8. Phosphorylated Smad1, 5 and 8 proteins form a complex
  with Smad4 and then are translocated into the nucleus where they interact with other
  transcription factors, such as Runx2 in osteoblasts." [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15621726
