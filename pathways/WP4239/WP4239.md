description: 'Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process during which
  cells lose their epithelial characteristics, and gain mesenchymal properties, such
  as increased motility. In colorectal cancer (CRC), EMT is associated with an invasive
  or metastatic phenotype. During EMT, tumor cells undergo tight junction dissolution,
  disruption of apical–basal polarity, and reorganization of the cytoskeletal architecture,
  which enable cells to develop an invasive phenotype. In cancer cells, EMT is abnormally
  regulated by extracellular stimuli derived from the tumor microenvironment, including
  growth factors and inflammatory cytokines, along with intra-tumoral physical stresses
  such as hypoxia. Therefore, EMT programming allows tumor cells to adapt to the constant
  changes of the human tumor microenvironment, and thus to successfully metastasize.
  This pathway summarizes the major signaling pathways and inducers that promote EMT
  in CRC.  A set of core transcription factors regulate EMT: SNAIL family of zinc-finger
  transcription factors SNAIL/SLUG; the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB) family
  of transcription factors ZEB1/ZEB2, and the TWIST family of basic helix-loop-helix
  (bHLH) transcription factors TWIST1/TWIST2.  (Adapted from Vu et al.)  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4239
