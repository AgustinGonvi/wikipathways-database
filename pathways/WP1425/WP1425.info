Description: "BMP signals are mediated by type I and II BMP receptors and their downstream molecules Smad1, 5 and 8. Phosphorylated Smad1, 5 and 8 proteins form a complex with Smad4 and then are translocated into the nucleus where they interact with other transcription factors, such as Runx2 in osteoblasts."
