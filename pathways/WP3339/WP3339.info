description: 19 WNT ligands and 10 FZD receptors have been identified in human cells; interactions amongst these ligands and receptors vary in a developmental and tissue-specific manner and lead to activation of so-called 'canonical' and 'non-canonical' WNT signaling.  In the canonical WNT signaling pathway, binding of a WNT ligand to the Frizzled (FZD) and lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) receptors results in the inactivation of the destruction complex, the stabilization and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and subsequent activation of T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor (TCF/LEF)-dependent transcription. Transcriptional activation in response to canonical WNT signaling controls processes such as cell fate, proliferation and self renewal of stem cells, as well as contributing to oncogenesis (reviewed in MacDonald et al, 2009; Saito-Diaz et al, 2013; Kim et al, 2013).
