description: Yeast, fungi, virus, and lysine-type peptidoglycan (k-type PGN) signal
  proteins persephone (psh) and GRASS in the Toll Pathway. These proteins signal downstream
  to sphinx1/2, spheroide, and spirit which leads to activation of Spatzle (spz).
  Spz binds to Toll which activates death domain-containing molecules (MyD88, Tube,
  Pelle). Pellino ubiquinates Pelle which allows TRAF to activate DIF which activates
  Dorsal facilitated by the ubiquitination of cactus. Dorsal translocates to nucleus
  to upregulate immune genes. The IMD pathway is activated by mono-diaminopimelic
  acid-type peptidoglycans (DAP-type PGN) that starts a cascade of activation of Fadd,
  Dredd, Tak1/Tab2 coomplex and leads to the activation, translocation, and effector
  gene promotion of Relish. The JAK/STAT pathway is activated by Virus and unpaired
  gene particles  binding to dome/JAK/STAT complex leading to the activation of the
  STAT complex which translocates to the nucleus to promote transcription of effector
  genes. This pathway was taken from Figure 2A of Severo et al.
