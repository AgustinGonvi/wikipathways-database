description: Apoptosis is a distinct form of cell death that is functionally and morphologically
  different from necrosis. Nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic shrinking,
  dilated endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane blebbing characterize apoptosis in general.
  Mitochondria remain morphologically unchanged. In 1972 Kerr et al introduced the
  concept of apoptosis as a distinct form of "cell-death", and the mechanisms of various
  apoptotic pathways are still being revealed today.
