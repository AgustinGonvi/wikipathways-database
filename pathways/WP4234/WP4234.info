description: This pathway contains metabolites which can be measured by the Biocrates lab (http://www.biocrates.com/). All nodes are annotated with Wikidata identifiers, to take the different stereo-isomers which could exist in other pathways into account. With help of BridgeDb, the annotations in this pathway are linked to several other databases (such a HMDB, ChEBI, Pubchem etc.). This pathway can be used to annotate your own Biocrates data-set, as well as being a starting point to visualise statistical analysis in one go.
