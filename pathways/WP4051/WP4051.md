description: Lipid droplets (LDs) are cytosolic structures found in cells of all eukaryotes,
  comprising a monolayer of phospholipids surrounding a core of uncharged lipids such
  as triglyceride (TAG) and sterol esters. CIDEA, CIDEB and CIDEC were first studied
  for their roles in promotion of apoptosis but they are also known to play a role
  in energy metabolism. CIDEA and C bind to lipid droplets and regulate their enlargement,
  thereby restricting lipolysis and favouring storage (by promoting net neutral lipid
  transfer from smaller to larger lipid droplets) (Gao & Goodman 2015). LD formation
  involves the partitioning of neutral lipids from their site of synthesis at the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol. The fat storage-inducing transmembrane
  proteins 1 and 2 (FITM1 and FITM2), associated with the ER membrane, mediate binding
  and partitioning of TAGs into LDs. The short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR)
  family is a large family of NAD- or NADP-dependent oxidoreductase enzymes. 17-beta-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) is a recently-discovered enzyme of unknown physiological
  function that is associated with lipid droplets and significantly upregulated in
  patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated
  protein (HILPDA) is a lipid droplet protein and stimulates intracellular lipid accumulation.  View
