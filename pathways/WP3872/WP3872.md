description: This pathway is based on Figure 8 of "Parathyroid hormone-related protein
  regulates cell survival pathways via integrin alpha6beta4-mediated activation of
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling."(See Bibliography). Parathyroid Hormone-related
  Protein Regulates Cell Survival Pathways via Integrin alpha6beta4-mediated Activation
  of PI3-K/Akt Signaling Intracrine PTHrP inhibits apoptosis by activating the PI3-K/Akt
  pathway by increasing levels of integrin A6B4, which signals in harmony with growth
  factor receptors. The activation of Akt increases the ratio of anti-apoptosis members
  to pro-apoptosis members in the Bcl-2 Family. The activation of Akt deactivates
  GSK-3 which leads to higher levels of c-myc, therefore leading to lower levels of
  apoptosis. Overall, intracrine PTHrP has the effect of increased cell survival on
  C4-2 cells.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3872
