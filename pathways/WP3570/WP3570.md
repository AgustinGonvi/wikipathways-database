description: Homology directed repair (HDR) through microhomology-mediated end joining
  (MMEJ) is an error prone process also known as alternative nonhomologous end joining
  (alt-NHEJ), although it does not involve proteins that participate in the classical
  NHEJ. Contrary to the classical NHEJ and other HDR pathways, homologous recombination
  repair (HRR) and single strand annealing (SSA), MMEJ does not require ATM activation.
  In fact, ATM activation inhibits MMEJ. Therefore, MMEJ may be triggered when the
  amount of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) overwhelms DNA repair machinery of higher
  fidelity or when cells are deficient in components of high fidelity DNA repair.<p>MMEJ
  is initiated by a limited resection of DNA DSB ends by the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN)
  and RBBP8 (CtIP), in the absence of CDK2-mediated RBBP8 phosphorylation and related
  BRCA1:BARD1 recruitment (Yun and Hiom 2009). Single strand DNA (ssDNA) at resected
  DNA DSB ends recruits PARP1 or PARP2 homo- or heterodimers, together with DNA polymerase
  theta (POLQ) and FEN1 5'-flap endonuclease. In a poorly studied sequence of events,
  POLQ promotes the annealing of two 3'-ssDNA overhangs through microhomologous regions
  that are optimally 10-19 nucleotides long. Using analogy with POLB-mediated long
  patch base excision repair (BER), it is plausible that PARP1 (or PARP2) dimers coordinate
  the extension of annealed 3'-ssDNA overhangs via POLQ-mediated strand displacement
  synthesis with FEN1-mediated cleavage of the resulting 5'-flaps (Liang et al. 2005,
  Mansour et al. 2011, Sharma et al. 2015, Kent et al. 2015, Ciccaldi et al. 2015,
  Mateos-Gomez et al. 2015). The MRN complex subsequently recruits DNA ligase 3 (LIG3)
  bound to XRCC1 (LIG3:XRCC1) to ligate the remaining single strand nicks (SSBs) at
  MMEJ sites (Della-Maria et al. 2011).<p>Similar to single strand annealing (SSA),
  MMEJ leads to deletion of one of the microhomology regions used for annealing and
  the DNA sequence in between two annealed microhomology regions. MMEJ, just like
  classical NHEJ, can result in genomic translocations (Ghezraoui et al. 2014). In
  addition, since POLQ is an error-prone DNA polymerase, MMEJ introduces frequent
  base substitutions (Ceccaldi et al. 2015).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5685939
