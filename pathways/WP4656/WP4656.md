description: Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare hereditary disorder that is classified
  as a ciliopathy, and is caused by mutations occurring in genes essential for the
  development and proper functioning of primary cellular cilia. These hair-like structures
  located on the cell membrane are responsible for detecting and relaying external
  signals to the interior of the cell. The defining JS feature is the molar tooth
  sign (MTS), which is the particular manner in which a characteristic malformation
  of midbrain appears in radiological imaging, and which causes delays in both intellectual
  and motor development. A visual representation of the pathways underlying JS pathogenesis
  was synthesized, which might provide a more complete understanding of the disease,
  possibly aiding in better diagnosis and more successful treatment. Data collection
  on the genes, pathways and interactions involved was done through a literature search
  in combination supported by online databases such as OMIM, STRING and GeneMANIA.
  The pathway was created using PathVisio version 3.3.0. Nodes were annotated using
  the appropriate Ensembl, ChEBI, or Uniprot-TrEMBL identifiers and standardized MIM
  notation was used to visualize the interactions between them.  A final pathway containing
  88 unique nodes and 71 interactions was created. The pathway highlights three functional
  or structural areas of the primary cilium that appear to play important roles in
  JS pathogenesis, namely the basal body or centriole, the transition zone and ciliary
  trafficking. Furthermore, two specific complexes seem to be of particular interest;
  the B9 ciliary complex and the centriolar satellite contain eight and three JS-associated
  protein respectively. Lastly, the ARL13B-PDE6D-INPP5E signaling network ensures
  the proper functioning of INPP5E, and enzyme that converts lipid ciliary membrane
  components. All three proteins have been found to be mutated in JS patients.
