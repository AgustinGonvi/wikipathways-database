description: Many biosynthetic reactions are coupled to the cleavage of ATP to yield
  AMP and pyrophosphate.  These reactions are typically freely reversible when carried
  out with purified substrates and enzymes in vitro.  In vivo, however, the pyrophosphate
  is rapdily and essentially irreversibly hydrolyzed by a ubiquitous inorganic pyrophosphatase.
  This hydrolysis has the effect of pulling the first reaction strongly in the direction
  of biosynthesis, at the expense of two high-energy phosphate bonds. Studies of human
  cells have identified two forms of the enzyme, one localized to the cytosol and
  the other to the mitochondrial matrix (Raja et al. 1981).  View original pathway
