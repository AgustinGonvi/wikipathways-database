description: 'Estrogen receptor refers to a group of receptors which are activated
  by the hormone 17&amp;#x3b2;-estradiol (estrogen). Two types of estrogen receptor
  exist: ER which is a member of the nuclear hormone family of intracellular receptors
  and the estrogen G protein coupled receptor GPR30 (GPER), which is a G-protein coupled
  receptor. The main function of the estrogen receptor is as a DNA binding transcription
  factor which regulates gene expression. However the estrogen receptor also has additional
  functions independent of DNA binding.'
