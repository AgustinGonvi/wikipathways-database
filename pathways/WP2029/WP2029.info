Description: miRNAs regulation of differentiation of numerous cell types.  This diagram shows progressive commitment and subsequent differentiation of various lineages from pluripotent stem cells. Some examples of the influence by miRNAs on specific cell fates are shown. The pathway is based on [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20621048 Fig 2 from Ivey and Srivastava].   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2029 CPTAC Assay Portal]
