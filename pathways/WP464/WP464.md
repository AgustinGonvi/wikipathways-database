description: "In eukaryotes, N-linked (asparagine-linked) glycosylation is the most
  common form of protein modification of secretory and membrane proteins, and is involved
  in a variety of cellular processes, such as protein folding, sorting and stability
  (reviewed in (CITS: [15189166][8472892][3896128])).   The initial steps of N-linked
  glycosylation, which are also known as the dolichol pathway of N-linked glycosylation,
  and lipid- and dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, involve the synthesis
  of a core oligosaccharide (glucosyl)<sub>3</sub>(mannosyl)<sub>9</sub>(N-acetylglucosamine)<sub>2</sub>,
  abbreviated, Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, on the lipid carrier,
  dolichol-pyrophosphate (Dol-PP) (reviewed in (CITS: [9878760][8472892][3896128])).
  \ The ordered assembly of the core oligosaccharide is highly conserved throughout
  eukaryotic evolution. The assembly starts on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), where N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-phosphate) is transferred
  from uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to dolichol-phosphate
  (Dol-P) followed by the addition of one N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and five mannose
  residues from UDP-GlcNAc and guanosine 5'-diphosphomannose (GDP-Man), respectively.
  The resulting lipid-linked precursor (Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dol)
  is translocated \"flipped\" into the lumen of the ER by a flippase, which which
  is endoded by <i>RFT1</i> in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>.  Once in the lumen, the oligosaccharide
  is extended by four mannose and three glucose residues derived from dolichyl-phosphate-mannose
  (Dol-P-Man) and dolichyl-phosphate-glucose (Dol-P-Glc), respectively. The enzyme
  complex oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) transfers the preassembled oligosaccharide,
  Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, from the lipid carrier Dol-PP
  to selected asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides as the polypeptides pass
  into the lumen of the ER (CITS: [11580295])(CITS: [9405463]).    Once attached to
  the protein, the N-linked oligosaccharide is further modified by a series of trimming
  and elongation reactions beginning in the ER and ending in the late Golgi compartment
  (CITS: [8054711]). In the ER, the oligosaccharide is trimmed of its 3 glucose residues
  and a specific mannose residue to form Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>. The glucose
  residues are removed by glucosidases I and II, and in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> the mannose
  is removed by the alpha-1,2-mannosidase Mns1p, which is part of the editing mechanism
  that promotes the exit of correctly folded glycoproteins from the ER (CITS: [9732283]).
  \ Once the four monosaccharides are removed, the glycoproteins are transported from
  the ER to the Golgi, where the yeast and mammalian pathways diverge (CITS: [3304149]).
  \ The lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathway is of particular interest
  in humans, because defects in the glycosyltransferases involved lead to congenital
  disorders of glycosylation (CITS: [11306275][17024709]). \t\t\t\t  SOURCE: SGD pathways,
