  "description": "The classical role of the G-protein beta/gamma dimer was believed to be the inactivation of the alpha subunit, Gbeta/gamma was viewed as a negative regulator of Galpha signalling. It is now known that Gbeta/gamma subunits can directly modulate many effectors, including some also regulated by G alpha.
