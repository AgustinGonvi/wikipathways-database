description: The TP53-uc.339-miRNA-CCNE2 network. TP53 directly inhibits the expression
  of ultraconserved region 339 (us339). Ultraconserved region 339 functions as an
  “entrapper” for CCNE2 targeting miR-339, -663b, and -95 leading to up-regulation
  of CCNE2 and increased tumor growth and migration.
