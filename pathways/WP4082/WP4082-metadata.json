  "description": "Nucleosides and free bases generated by RNA and DNA breakdown are converted back to nucleotide monophosphates, allowing them to re-enter the pathways of nucleotide biosynthesis and interconversion. Under normal conditions, DNA turnover is limited and deoxyribonucleotide salvage operates at a correspondingly low level (Watts 1974).
