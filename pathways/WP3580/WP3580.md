description: Methionine is an essential amino acid, which animals cannot synthesize.
  In bacteria and plants, methionine is synthesized from aspartate [MD:M00017]. S-Adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), synthesized from methionine and ATP, is a methyl group donor in many important
  transfer reactions including DNA methylation for regulation of gene expression.
  SAM may also be used to regenerate methionine in the methionine salvage pathway   Pathway
  adapted from [http://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00270 KEGG].  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3580
