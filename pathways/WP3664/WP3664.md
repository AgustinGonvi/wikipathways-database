description: The Wnt/B-catenin pathway begins with Wnt family activation by MBOAT
  that allows Wnt proteins to translocate out of a cell and bind to FZD and LRP to
  form a complex. This complex stimulates B-catenin to bind to the TF/LEF complex
  to regulate gene expression in the cell. Regulation of this pathway takes place
  at different levels. The Wnt signaling can be inhibited by DKK3, FZD7, SFRP4, FZD8,
  V3Nter, and Wnt antibodies or FZD antibodies that inhibit FZD and do not allow formation
  of FZD/LRP/Wnt complex. Another level of regulation is the destruction complex (TNKS/AXIN/GSK3B/APC/CK1a/CK1e)
  that is regulated by XAV939, DVL, IC261, and Pyrvinium to catalyze the breakdown
  of B-catenin, inhibiting its binding to the TCF/LEF complex. Several substances
  including retinoids, glucocorticoids, and ICG-001 inhibit the TCF/LEF complex to
  stop Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathways from promoting gene transcription. This pathway
  is based on figure 4 from White et al.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted
  assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3664
