description: This pathway model provides a holistic overview of the various signalling
  pathways which promote pancreatic cancer with the direct involvment of neuropilin
  1, commonly known as NRP1. The multifaceted role of NRP1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
  (PDAC) constitutes it as a promising therapeutic target for the fatal disease. The
  curation of the model was conducted by using the review done by Matkar et al. as
  a starting point and combining information gathered by several other studies investigating
  this particular phenomenon.
