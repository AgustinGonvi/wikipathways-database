description: Within the group of aminoacidurias, several renal amino acid transporters
  involved in reabsorption might be affected; this absorption takes place in the proximal
  convoluted tubule (PCT). This pathway presents four of these disorders, which proteins
  involved in the apical surface and one disorder where the protein is located at
  the basolateral surface of the renal tubule. One of these disorders, iminoglycinuria,
  is seen as a benign disease.   This pathway was inspired by Chapter 6 (edition 4)
  of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
