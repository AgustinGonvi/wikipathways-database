description: Cholesterol is synthesized de novo from acetyl CoA. The overall synthetic
  process is outlined in the attached illustration. Enzymes whose regulation plays
  a major role in determining the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the body are highlighted
  in red, and connections to other metabolic processes are indicated. The transformation
  of zymosterol into cholesterol can follow either of routes, one in which reduction
  of the double bond in the isooctyl side chain is the final step (cholesterol synthesis
  via desmosterol, also known as the Bloch pathway) and one in which this reduction
  is the first step (cholesterol biosynthesis via lathosterol, also known as the Kandutsch-Russell
  pathway). The former pathway is prominent in the liver and many other tissues while
  the latter is prominent in skin, where it may serve as the source of the 7-dehydrocholesterol
  that is the starting point for the synthesis of D vitamins. Defects in several of
  the enzymes involved in this process are associated with human disease and have
  provided useful insights into the regulatory roles of cholesterol and its synthetic
  intermediates in human development (Gaylor 2002; Herman 2003; Kandutsch & Russell
  1960; Mitsche et al. 2015; Song et al. 2005).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=191273
