description: Metabolism of sphingomyelin by the sphingomyelinase, ceramidase (Cer'ase)
  and the sphingosine kinase (SK) enzymes results in formation of S1P and receptor
  activation. Autocrine and paracrine modes of receptor activation have been implied
  but have yet to be rigorously proven. Critical signaling molecules, such as phospholipase
  C (PLC), ERK, PI3K, and Akt are activated. Active Akt binds to the receptor and
  phosphorylates the third intracellular loop, which is essential for Rac activation.
