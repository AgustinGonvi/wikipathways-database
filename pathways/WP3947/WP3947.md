description: Benekareddy et al observed the phenomenon that rats who were maternally
  separated show increased levels of induced anxiety-related behaviour during adulthood.
  Type 2 serotonin receptors have been implicated in anxiety related behaviour and
  may be suitable targets for reducing anxiety response. Benekareddy et al report
  that treatment with ketanserin (a serotonergic antagonist) during postnatal life
  blocked the long-lasting effects of maternal separation on anxiety behavior in the
  open field test and the elevated plus maze. Immediate Early Genes such as Arc have
  been found to be significantly affected in expression (Benekareddy et al). The downstream
  and upstream gene products of Arc were partly elucidated and presented in a pathway.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3947
