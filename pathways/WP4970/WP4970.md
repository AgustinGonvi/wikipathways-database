description: Galanin, a 29-30 amino acid neuropeptide named to be so, as a glycine
  residue occupies the position at N-terminal and an alanine residue at C-terminal.
  Galanin is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems in mammalian
  species. The galanin family of peptides includes ‘GMAP’ (Gaalanin- Message associated
  peptide), ‘GALP’ (Galanin-like Peptide), and its splice variant ‘Alarin’ along with
  Galanin. There are three known G-protein coupled receptor subtypes of Galanin, namely,
  GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3. Galaninergic signaling is predominantly inhibitory which
  mainly involves MAPK, AKT, AC pathways Galanin peptides have a wide range of non-neuronal
  functions as well as classic neuromodulatory roles, therefore it is recommended
  to consider as regulatory peptides. Galanin in general is associated with several
  biological functions such as arousal and sleep regulation, nociception, learning,
  inflammation, feeding, and neuroendocrine regulation. It is also implicated in diseases
  like Alzheimer’s, depression, epilepsy, mood disorders, stress, anxiety, diabetes
  mellitus, and chronic pain.  The creation of this pathway is described in [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33136286/
  Gopalakrishnan et al.]
