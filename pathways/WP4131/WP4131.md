description: 'Fatty acids derived from the diet and synthesized de novo in the liver
  are assembled into triglycerides (triacylglycerols) for transport and storage. Synthesis
  proceeds in steps of conversion of fatty acyl-CoA to phosphatidic acid, conversion
  of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, and conversion of diacylglycerol to triacylglycerol
  (Takeuchi & Reue 2009).<br>Hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to yield fatty acids and
  glycerol is a tightly regulated part of energy metabolism. A central part in this
  regulation is played by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a neutral lipase abundant
  in adipocytes and skeletal and cardiac muscle, but also abundant in ovarian and
  adrenal tissue, where it mediates cholesterol ester hydrolysis, yielding cholesterol
  for steroid biosynthesis. The hormones to which it is sensitive include catecholamines
  (e.g., epinephrine), ACTH, and glucagon, all of which trigger signaling cascades
  that lead to its phosphorylation and activation, and insulin, which sets off events
  leading to its dephosphorylation and inactivation (Kraemer & Shen 2002).<p>The processes
  of triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester hydrolysis are also regulated by subcellular
  compartmentalization: these lipids are packaged in cytosolic particles and the enzymes
  responsible for their hydrolysis, and perhaps for additional steps in their metabolism,
  are organized at the surfaces of these particles (e.g., Brasaemle et al. 2004).  View
