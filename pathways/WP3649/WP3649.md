description: This pathway is modeled after figure 5 from Kweon et al. The WNT signaling
  pathway activates Beta-catenin which inhibits serine and cysteine proteases. This
  inhibition  of these proteins increases MeCP2 stability and induces epigenetic repression
  of Ppar-y leading to hepatic stellate cell myofibroblastic activation causing liver
  fibrosis which can lead to liver cirrhosis.
