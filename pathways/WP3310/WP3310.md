description: Of the roughly 1000 human mitochondrial proteins only 13 proteins, all
  of them hydrophobic inner membrane proteins that are components of the oxidative
  phosphorylation apparatus, are encoded in the mitochondrial genome and translated
  by mitoribosomes at the matrix face of the inner membrane (reviewed in Herrmann
  et al. 2012, Hallberg and Larsson 2014, Lightowlers et al. 2014). The remainder,
  including all proteins of the mitochondrial translation system, are encoded in the
  nucleus and imported from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. Translation in the
  mitochondrion reflects both the bacterial origin of the organelle and subsequent
  divergent evolution during symbiosis (reviewed in Huot et al. 2014, Richman et al.
  2014). Human mitochondrial ribosomes have a low sedimentation coefficient of only
  55S, but at 2.71 MDa they retain a similar mass to E. coli 70S particles. The 55S
  particles are protein-rich compared to both cytosolic ribosomes and eubacterial
  ribosomes. This is due to shorter mt-rRNAs, mitochondria-specific proteins, and
  numerous rearrangements in individual protein positions within the two ribosome
  subunits (inferred from bovine ribosomes in Sharma et al. 2003, Greber et al. 2014,
  Kaushal et al. 2014, reviewed in Agrawal and Sharma 2012).<br>Mitochondrial mRNAs
  have either no untranslated leader or short leaders of 1-3 nucleotides, with the
  exception of the 2 bicistronic transcripts, RNA7 and RNA14, which have overlapping
  orfs that encode ND4L/ND4 and ATP8/ATP6 respectively. Translation is believed to
  initiate with the mRNA binding the 28S subunit:MTIF3 (28S subunit:IF-3Mt, 28S subunit:IF2mt)
  complex together with MTIF2:GTP (IF-2Mt:GTP, IF2mt:GTP) at the matrix face of the
  inner membrane (reviewed in Christian and Spremulli 2012). MTIF3 can dissociate
  55S particles in preparation for initiation, enhances formation of initiation complexes,
  and inhibits N-formylmethionine-tRNA (fMet-tRNA) binding to 28S subunits in the
  absence of mRNA. Binding of fMet-tRNA to the start codon of the mRNA results in
  a stable complex while absence of a start codon at the 5' end of the mRNA causes
  eventual dissociation of the mRNA from the 28S subunit. After recognition of a start
  codon, the 39S subunit then binds the stable complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, and the
  initiation factors MTIF3 and MTIF2:GDP dissociate.<br>Translation elongation then
  proceeds by cycles of aminoacyl-tRNAs binding, peptide bond formation, and displacement
  of deacylated tRNAs. In each cycle an aminoacyl-tRNA in a complex with TUFM:GTP
  (EF-Tu:GTP) binds at the A-site of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed, and TUFM:GDP
  dissociates. The elongating polypeptide bonded to the tRNA at the P-site is transferred
  to the aminoacyl group at the A-site by peptide bond formation at the peptidyl transferase
  center, leaving a deacylated tRNA at the P-site and the elongating polypeptide attached
  to the tRNA at the A-site. The polypeptide is co-translationally inserted into the
  inner mitochondrial membrane via an interaction with OXA1L (Haque et al. 2010, reviewed
  in Ott and Hermann 2010). After peptide bond formation, GFM1:GTP (EF-Gmt:GTP) then
  binds the ribosome complex, GTP is hydrolyzed, GFM1:GDP dissociates, and the ribosome
  translocates 3 nucleotides in the 3' direction along the mRNA, relocating the polypeptide-tRNA
  to the P-site and allowing another cycle to begin. TUFM:GDP is regenerated to TUFM:GTP
  by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor TSFM (EF-Ts, EF-TsMt).<br>Translation
  is terminated when MTRF1L:GTP (MTRF1a:GTP) recognizes an UAA or UAG termination
  codon at the A-site of the ribosome (Tsuboi et al. 2009). GTP hydrolysis does not
  appear to be required. The tRNA-aminoacyl bond between the translated polypeptide
  and the final tRNA at the P-site is hydrolyzed by the 39S subunit, facilitating
  release of  the polypeptide. MRRF (RRF) and GFM2:GTP (EF-G2mt:GTP) then act to release
  the remaining tRNA and mRNA from the ribosome and dissociate the 55S ribosome into
  28S and 39S subunits.<br>Mutations have been identified in genes encoding mitochondrial
  ribosomal proteins and translation factors. These have been shown to be pathogenic,
  causing neurological and other diseases (reviewed in Koopman et al. 2013, Pearce
  et al. 2013).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5368287
