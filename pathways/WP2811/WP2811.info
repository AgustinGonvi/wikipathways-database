Description: Young and environmentally enriched exosomes deliver functional miR-219 that impacts oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Schematic illustration of the involvement of miR-219 in oligodendrocyte differentiation.  Upon exposure to nutritive exosomes, neural stem cells preferentially enter the oligodendrocyte lineage due to the inhibition of the proneurogenic factor NeuroD1. miR-219 also suppresses expression of a number of other factors that inhibit OPC differentiation, such as PDGFRa, a receptor for a mitogenic factor that promotes proliferation and prohibits differentiation. Finally, miR-219 decreases levels of ELOVL7, a regulator of lipid metabolism whose over-activity could lead to demyelination.
