description: The MTF1:zinc complex in the nucleus binds Metal Response Elements (MREs),
  DNA containing the core consensus sequence 5'-TGCRCNC-3', and activates or represses
  transcription depending on the context of the MRE (reviewed in Laity and Andrews
  2007, Jackson et al. 2008, Gunther et al. 2012, Grzywacz et al. 2015). The 6 zinc
  fingers of each MTF1 monomer have different affinities for zinc and evidence from
  the mouse homolog indicates that different concentrations of zinc, and hence different
  metal loads in MTF1, activate different subsets of target genes (Wang et al. 2004,
  Dong et al. 2015). Genes activated by MTF1 include those encoding metallothioneins,
  zinc transporters, and stress-response proteins (Hardyman et al. 2016).  View original
