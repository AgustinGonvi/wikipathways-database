  The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway has been shown to have a significant correlation
  with the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. The signaling pathway
  regulates many cellular processes such as protein synthesis, proliferation, survival,
  metabolism, and differentiation, all factors that would increase a cancerous cell's
  ability to survive. Scientists have explored the use of various inhibitors for different
  parts of the signaling pathway, and have been faced with varying success.    Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3844
