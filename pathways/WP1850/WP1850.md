description: 'Nitric oxide (NO), a multifunctional second messenger, is implicated
  in physiological processes in mammals that range from immune response and potentiation
  of synaptic transmission to dilation of blood vessels and muscle relaxation. NO
  is a highly active molecule that diffuses across cell membranes and cannot be stored
  inside the producing cell. Its signaling capacity is controlled at the levels of
  biosynthesis and local availability. Its production by NO synthases is under complex
  and tight control, being regulated at transcriptional and translational levels,
  through co- and posttranslational modifications, and by subcellular localization.
  NO is synthesized from L-arginine by a family of nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Three
  NOS isoforms have been characterized: neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS1) primarily found
  in neuronal tissue and skeletal muscle; inducible NOS (iNOS, NOS2) originally isolated
  from macrophages and later discovered in many other cell types; and endothelial
  NOS (eNOS, NOS3) present in vascular endothelial cells, cardiac myocytes, and in
  blood platelets. The enzymatic activity of all three isoforms is dependent on calmodulin,
  which binds to nNOS and eNOS at elevated intracellular calcium levels, while it
  is tightly associated with iNOS even at basal calcium levels. As a result, the enzymatic
  activity of nNOS and eNOS is modulated by changes in intracellular calcium levels,
  leading to transient NO production, while iNOS continuously releases NO independent
  of fluctuations in intracellular calcium levels and is mainly regulated at the gene
  expression level (Pacher et al. 2007).<p>The NOS enzymes share a common basic structural
  organization and requirement for substrate cofactors for enzymatic activity. A central
  calmodulin-binding motif separates an NH2-terminal oxygenase domain from a COOH-terminal
  reductase domain. Binding sites for cofactors NADPH, FAD, and FMN are located within
  the reductase domain, while binding sites for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and heme
  are located within the oxygenase domain. Once calmodulin binds, it facilitates electron
  transfer from the cofactors in the reductase domain to heme enabling nitric oxide
  production. Both nNOS and eNOS contain an additional insert (40-50 amino acids)
  in the middle of the FMN-binding subdomain that serves as autoinhibitory loop, destabilizing
  calmodulin binding at low calcium levels and inhibiting electron transfer from FMN
  to the heme in the absence of calmodulin.  iNOS does not contain this insert. <p>In
  this Reactome pathway module, details of eNOS activation and regulation are annotated.
  Originally identified as endothelium-derived relaxing factor, eNOS derived NO is
  a critical signaling molecule in vascular homeostasis. It regulates blood pressure
  and vascular tone, and is involved in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation,
  platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion. Loss of endothelium derived NO is
  a key feature of endothelial dysfunction, implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension
  and atherosclerosis. The endothelial isoform eNOS is unique among the nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS) family in that it is co-translationally modified at its amino terminus
  by myristoylation and is further acylated by palmitoylation (two residues next to
  the myristoylation site). These modifications target eNOS to the plasma membrane
  caveolae and lipid rafts. <p>Factors that stimulate eNOS activation and nitric oxide
  (NO) production include fluid shear stress generated by blood flow, vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF), bradykinin, estrogen, insulin, and angiopoietin. The activity
  of eNOS is further regulated by numerous post-translational modifications, including
  protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and subcellular localization. <p>Following
  activation, eNOS shuttles between caveolae and other subcellular compartments such
  as the noncaveolar plasma membrane portions, Golgi apparatus, and perinuclear structures.
  This subcellular distribution is variable depending upon cell type and mode of activation.
  <p>Subcellular localization of eNOS has a profound effect on its ability to produce
  NO as the availability of its substrates and cofactors will vary with location.
  eNOS is primarily particulate, and depending on the cell type, eNOS can be found
  in several membrane compartments:  plasma membrane caveolae, lipid rafts, and intracellular
  membranes such as the Golgi complex.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=202131
