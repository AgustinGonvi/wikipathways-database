description: 'Named after the English biochemist Herbert Grace Crabtree, the Crabtree
  effect describes the phenomenon whereby the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, produces
  ethanol (alcohol) in aerobic conditions and high external glucose concentrations
  rather than producing biomass via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the usual
  process occurring aerobically in most yeasts e.g. Kluyveromyces spp. This phenomenon
  is observed in most species of the Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, Debaryomyces,
  Brettanomyces, Torulopsis, Nematospora, and Nadsonia genera. Increasing concentrations
  of glucose accelerates glycolysis (the breakdown of glucose) which results in the
  production of appreciable amounts of ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation.
  This reduces the need of oxidative phosphorylation done by the TCA cycle via the
  electron transport chain and therefore decreases oxygen consumption. The phenomenon
  is believed to have evolved as a competition mechanism (due to the antiseptic nature
  of ethanol) around the time when the first fruits on Earth fell from the trees.
  The crabtree effect works by repressing respiration by the fermentation pathway,
  dependent on the substrate.  Description source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crabtree_effect
