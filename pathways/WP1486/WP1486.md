description: 'This pathway describes the mechanism of endo- and exocytosis of CFTR
  channel, based on the article: "New insights into cystic fibrosis: molecular switches
  that regulate CFTR" by Guggino et al. 2006. On the left side (in red) the endocytic
  mechanism is shown. Respectively in green on the right sight the exocytic mechanism.  We
  integrated the functions of PDZ proteins, SNAREs and Rho GTPases.'
