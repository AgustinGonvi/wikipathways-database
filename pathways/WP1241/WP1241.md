description: Metabolism of xenobiotic compounds consists of phase I and a phase II
  biotransformation reactions, being compound modification and conjugation reactions
  respectively. In phase I biotransformation, the compound is modificated via oxidation,
  reduction, hydrolysis, or other minor reactions, to reveal a reactive group to which
  a conjugation molecule can react to. In phase II, a small conjugation molecule reacts
  with the phase I modified molecule, producing a much more water-soluble molecule
  that can be excreted more easily. Glucuronidation is a phase II biotransformation
  reaction in which glucuronide acts as a conjugation molecule and binds to a substrate
  via the catalysis of glucuronosyltransferases. First, in a series of reactions the
  cosubstrate uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA) is formed. The glucuronosyltransferases
  (UGTs) then catalyze the transfer of glucuronic acid from UDPGA to a substrate resulting
  in a glucuronidated substrate and leaving uridine 5'-diphosphate. UGTs are a very
  broad and divers group of enzymes and count as the most significant  group of conjugation
  enzymes in xenobiotic metabolism, qualitatively because glucuronic acid can be coupled
  to a large diversity of functional groups and quantitatively because of the large
  and divers number of substrates that are formed.
