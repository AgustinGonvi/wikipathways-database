description: FOXO transcription factors induce expression of several genes that negatively regulate proliferation of different cell types, such as erythroid progenitors (Bakker et al. 2004, Wang et al. 2015) and neuroepithelial progenitor cells in the telencephalon (Seoane et al. 2004).<br>Transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors CDKN1A (p21Cip1) is directly stimulated by FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 (Seoane et al. 2004, Tinkum et al. 2013). FOXO transcription factors can cooperate with the SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex to induce CDKN1A transcription in response to TGF-beta signaling (Seoane et al. 2004).<br>FOXO transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 stimulate transcription of the CDKN1B (p27Kip1) gene, but direct binding of FOXOs to the CDKN1B gene locus has not been demonstrated (Dijkers et al. 2000, Medema et al. 2000, Lees et al. 2008).<br>FOXO3 and FOXO4, and possibly FOXO1, directly stimulate transcription of the GADD45A  gene (Tran et al. 2002, Furukawa Hibi et al. 2002, Hughes et al. 2011, Sengupta et al. 2011, Ju et al. 2014).<br>Transcription of the retinoblastoma family protein RBL2 (p130), involved in the maintenance of quiescent (G0) state, is directly stimulated by FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 (Kops et al. 2002, Chen et al. 2006).<br>Transcription of the anti-proliferative protein CCNG2 is directly stimulated by FOXO1 and FOXO3, and possibly FOXO4 (Martinez Gac et al. 2004, Chen et al. 2006). Transcription of the anti-proliferative protein BTG1 is directly stimulated by FOXO3 (Bakker et al. 2004, Bakker et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2015).<br>Transcription of CAV1, encoding caveolin-1, involved in negative regulation of growth factor receptor signaling and establishment of quiescent cell phenotype, is directly stimulated by FOXO1 and FOXO3 (van den Heuvel et al. 2005, Roy et al. 2008, Nho et al. 2013, Sisci et al. 2013).<br>FOXO1 and FOXO3 promote transcription of the KLF4 gene, encoding a transcription factor Krueppel-like factor 4, which inhibits proliferation of mouse B cells (Yusuf et al. 2008).<br> FOXO1, together with the p-2S-SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex, stimulates transcription of the MSTN gene, encoding myostatin, a TGF-beta family member that stimulates differentiation of myoblasts (Allen and Unterman 2007).
