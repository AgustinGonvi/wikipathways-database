  "description": "Xbp-1 (S) binds the sequence CCACG in ER Stress Responsive Elements (ERSE, consensus sequence CCAAT (N)9 CCACG) located upstream from many genes. The ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y, a heterotrimer, binds the CCAAT portion of the ERSE and together the IRE1-alpha: NF-Y complex activates transcription of a set of chaperone genes including DNAJB9, EDEM, RAMP4, p58IPK, and others. This results in an increase in protein folding activity in the ER.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=381038 Reactome].",
