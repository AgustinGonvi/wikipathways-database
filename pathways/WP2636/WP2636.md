description: The pathway was modeled after Figure 2 in Li, et al. 2008 and is based
  on the common pathways identified in their study as well as protein interaction
  data. Specifically, glutamate and dopamine neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions
  trigger long-term potentiation, MAPK and GnRH signaling and gap junction regulation
  (green outlined pathway nodes). Related functional modules such as depolarization,
  gene expression and cytoskeleton regulation are also indicated (non-outlined pathway
  nodes). Among the several positive feedback loops identified in this pathway, the
  authors highlighted fast and slow ones in red and blue, respectively.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2636
