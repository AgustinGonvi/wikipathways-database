description: 'The androgen receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor family of
  ligand activated transcription factors. These receptors bind to steroid hormones,
  thyroid hormone, retinoids and vitamin D among others, dimerize and bind to DNA.
  Its ligands include testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione. Stimulation
  of the receptor activates the SMAD signaling module.  Source: http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_4'
