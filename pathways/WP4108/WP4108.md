description: 'The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription
  factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix/PER-ARNT-SIM family of DNA binding
  proteins and controls the expression of a diverse set of genes. Two major types
  of environmental compounds can activate AHR signaling: halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons
  such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
  (PAH) such as benzo(a)pyrene. Unliganded AHR forms a complex in the cytosol with
  two copies of 90kD heat shock protein (HSP90AB1), one X-associated protein (AIP),
  and one p23 molecular chaperone protein (PTGES3). After ligand binding and activation,
  the AHR complex translocates to the nucleus, disassociates from the chaperone subunits,
  dimerises with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) and transactivates
  target genes via binding to xenobiotic response elements (XREs) in their promoter
  regions. AHR targets genes of Phase I and Phase II metabolism, such as cytochrome
  P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), cytochorme P450 1B1 (CYP1B1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase
  I (NQO1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 (ALHD3A1). This is thought to be an organism''s
  response to foreign chemical exposure and normally, foreign chemicals are made less
  reactive by the induction and therefore increased activity of these enzymes (Beischlag
  et al. 2008).<br><br>AHR itself is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor
  (AHRR, aka BHLHE77, KIAA1234), an evolutionarily conserved bHLH-PAS protein that
  inhibits both xenobiotic-induced and constitutively active AHR transcriptional activity
  in many species. AHRR  resides predominantly in the nuclear compartment where it
  competes with AHR for binding to ARNT. As a result, there is competition between
  AHR:ARNT and AHRR:ARNT complexes for binding to XREs in target genes and AHRR can
  repress the transcription activity of AHR (Hahn et al. 2009, Haarmann-Stemmann &
  Abel 2006).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8937144
