  "description": "In the execution phase of apoptosis, effector caspases cleave vital cellular  proteins leading to the morphological changes that characterize apoptosis. These changes include destruction of the nucleus and other organelles, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage and cell detachment and  membrane blebbing (reviewed in Fischer et al., 2003).
