description: The pathway describes how anthocyanins are synthesized from the amino
  acid phenylalanine through a series of enzymatic steps involving phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT).
  These enzymes convert phenylalanine into various intermediates, ultimately leading
  to the formation of anthocyanins, which are then stored in cell vacuoles.
