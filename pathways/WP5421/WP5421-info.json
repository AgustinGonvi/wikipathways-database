    "description": "The pathway describes how anthocyanins are synthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine through a series of enzymatic steps involving phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT). These enzymes convert phenylalanine into various intermediates, ultimately leading to the formation of anthocyanins, which are then stored in cell vacuoles.",
