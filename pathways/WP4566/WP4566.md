description: Chronic stimulation of the PDGFRA receptor results in decreased phosphorylation
  of RSK1/2 and S6K1/2, which subsequently impairs the phosphorylation of S6 ribosome
  protein and associated ribosome biogenesis and 5′ TOP mRNA translation. The phosphorylation
  of 4EBP1 and PDCD4 are suppressed, which subsequently limits the components of the
  eIF4F complex (eIF4E and eIF4A) from joining into the complex. In addition, the
  phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF4B is also decreased. These
  changes result in a suppressed CAP-dependent translation initiation in cells with
  chronic stimulated PDGFRA signaling compared with acute stimulated ones.  Based
  on figure S7 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238596/ Zhou et
  al].
