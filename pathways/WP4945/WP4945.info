description: This pathway is a meta-pathway that represents an updated version of the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) of Inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I of nigro-striatal neurons leads to parkinsonian motor deficits [https://aopwiki.org/aops/3 AOP-Wiki:3]. All Key Events are present as Key Event nodes, with their corresponding molecular pathways as pathway nodes.
