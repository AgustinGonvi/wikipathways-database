SUMOylation of DNA
replication
proteins	Pathway	R-HSA-4615885	Reactome	The sliding clamp protein PCNA, Aurora-A, Aurora-B, Borealin, and various topoisomerases can be SUMOylated (reviewed in Wan et al. 2012). SUMOylation of PCNA appears to reduce formation of double-strand breaks and inappropriate recombination (reviewed in Watts 2006, Watts 2007, Dieckman et al. 2012, Gazy and Kupiec 2012). SUMOylation of Aurora-A, Aurora-B, and Borealin is necessary for proper chromosome segregation. SUMOylation of topoisomerases is observed in response to damage caused by inhibitors of topoisomerases.

SUMOylation of
chromatin
organization
proteins	Pathway	R-HSA-4551638	Reactome	SUMOylation of proteins involved in chromatin organization  regulates gene expression in several ways: direct influence on catalytic activity of enzymes that modify chromatin, recruitment of proteins that form repressive (e.g. PRC1) or activating complexes on chromatin, recruitment of proteins to larger bodies (e.g PML bodies) in the nucleus (reviewed in Cubenas-Potts and Matunis 2013).
SUMOylation of
intracellular
receptors	Pathway	R-HSA-4090294	Reactome	At least 17 nuclear receptors have been discovered to be SUMOylated (reviewed in Treuter and Venteclef 2011, Wadosky et al. 2012, Knutson and Lange 2013). In all but a few cases (notably AR and RORA) SUMOylation causes transcriptional repression. Repression by SUMOylation is believed to occur through several mechanisms: interference with DNA binding, recruitment of corepressors, retention of corepressors at non-target promoters (transrepression), re-localization of nuclear receptors within the nucleus, interference with dimerization of receptors, and interference (crosstalk) with other post-translational modifications. SUMOylation of receptors affects inflammation and disease processes (Anbalagan et al. 2012).
SUMOylation of DNA
damage response and
repair proteins	Pathway	R-HSA-3108214	Reactome	Several factors that participate in DNA damage response and repair are SUMOylated (reviewed in Dou et al. 2011, Bekker-Jensen and Mailand 2011, Ulrich 2012, Psakhye and Jentsch 2012, Bologna and Ferrari 2013, Flotho and Melchior 2013, Jackson and Durocher 2013). SUMOylation can alter enzymatic activity and protein stability or it can serve to recruit additional factors. For example, SUMOylation of Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) causes TDG to lose affinity for its product, an abasic site opposite a G residue, and thus increases turnover of the enzyme. During repair of double-strand breaks SUMO1, SUMO2, SUMO3, and the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4 accumulate at double-strand breaks where BRCA1, HERC1, RNF168, MDC1, and TP53BP1 are SUMOylated. SUMOylation of BRCA1 may increase its ubiquitin ligase activity while SUMOylation of MDC1 and HERC2 appears to play a role in recruitment of proteins such as RNF4 and RNF8 to double strand breaks. Similarly SUMOylation of RPA1 (RPA70) recruits RAD51 in the homologous recombination pathway.
SUMOylation of DNA
methylation
proteins	Pathway	R-HSA-4655427	Reactome	The known DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) can be SUMOylated (reviewed in Xu et al. 2010, Denis et al. 2011). SUMOylation affects the catalytic activity of DNMT1 and the protein interactions of DNMT3A.

SUMOylation of RNA
binding proteins	Pathway	R-HSA-4570464	Reactome	SUMOylation of RNA-binding proteins (Li et al. 2004, reviewed in Filosa et al. 2013) alters their interactions with nucleic acids and with proteins. Whereas SUMOylation of HNRNPC decreases its affinity for nucleic acid (ssDNA), SUMOylation of NOP58 is required for binding of snoRNAs. SUMOylation of HNRNPK is required for its coactivation of TP53-dependent transcription.

SUMOylation of
transcription
cofactors	Pathway	R-HSA-3899300	Reactome	SUMO1,2, and 3 are predominantly located in the nucleus and targets of SUMOylation are predominantly nuclear. Transcription cofactors are nuclear proteins that generally do not bind DNA themselves but interact with DNA-bound factors and influence transcription. SUMOylation of transcription cofactors usually inhibits the activity of the cofactor (reviewed in Girdwood et al. 2004, Gill 2005, Lyst and Stancheva 2007, Garcia-Dominguez and Reyes 2009). In the cases of coactivators such as PPARGC1A (PGC-1alpha) this results in decreased transcription; in the cases of corepressors such as MBD1 this results in increased transcription.
SUMOylation of
SUMOylation
proteins	Pathway	R-HSA-4085377	Reactome	SUMOylation processes themselves can be controlled by SUMOylation (reviewed in Wilkinson and Henley 2010). The SUMO E3 ligases PIAS4, RANBP2, and TOPORS are SUMOylated, as is the single SUMO E2 enzyme, UBE2I (UBC9). SUMOylation affects the subcellular location of PIAS4 and TOPORS and affects the activity of PIAS4 and UBE2I.

SUMOylation of
ubiquitinylation
proteins	Pathway	R-HSA-3232142	Reactome	Several ubiquitin E3 ligases are regulated by SUMOylation (reviewed in Wilson and Heaton 2008). SUMOylation appears to be necessary for nuclear import of MDM2, the E3 ligase that ubiquitinylates TP53 (p53). SUMOylation of VHL abolishes its ubiquitin ligase activity. HERC2, RNF168, and BRCA1 are ubiquitin ligases that are SUMOylated during DNA damage response and repair.

SUMOylation of
transcription
factors	Pathway	R-HSA-3232118	Reactome	Proteins classified as transcription factors constitute a disproportionate number of SUMOylation targets. In most cases SUMOylation inhibits transcriptional activation, however in some cases such as TP53 (p53) SUMOylation can enhance activation. Inhibition of transcription by SUMOylation may be due to interference with DNA binding, re-localization to inactive nuclear bodies, or recruitment of repressive cofactors such as histone deacetylases (reviewed in Girdwood et al. 2004, Gill 2005).
SUMOylation of
immune response
proteins	Pathway	R-HSA-4755510	Reactome	NF-kappaB transcription factors are sequestered in the cytosol due to their association with IkappaB. During activation of NF-kappaB, IKK phosphorylates IkappaB, releasing NF-kappaB for importation into the nucleus. NF-kappaB transcription factors, the NFKBIA component of IkappaB, and subunits of the IKK complex can be SUMOylated (reviewed in Kracklauer and Schmidt 2003, Liu et al. 2013). SUMOylations of IkappaB, NFKBIA, and RELA inhibit NF-kappaB signaling; SUMOylation of NFKB2 is required for proteolytic processing.
