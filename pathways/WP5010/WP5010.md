description: 'SUMO proteins are conjugated to lysine residues of target proteins via
  an isopeptide bond with the C-terminal glycine of SUMO (reviewed in Zhao 2007, Gareau
  and Lima 2010, Hannoun et al. 2010, Citro and Chiocca 2013, Yang and Chiang 2013).
  Proteomic analyses indicate that SUMO is conjugated to hundreds of proteins and
  most targets of SUMOylation are nuclear (Vertegal et al. 2006, Bruderer et al. 2011,
  Tatham et al. 2011, Da Silva et al. 2012, Becker et al. 2013). Within the nucleus
  SUMOylation targets include transcription factors (TFs), transcription cofactors
  (TCs), intracellular (nuclear) receptors, RNA binding proteins, RNA splicing proteins,
  polyadenylation proteins, chromatin organization proteins, DNA replication proteins,
  DNA methylation proteins, DNA damage response and repair proteins, immune response
  proteins, SUMOylation proteins, and ubiquitinylation proteins. Mitochondrial fission
  proteins are SUMOylated at the mitochondrial outer membrane.<br>UBE2I (UBC9), the
  E2 activating enzyme of the SUMO pathway, is itself also a SUMO E3 ligase. Most
  SUMOylation reactions will proceed with only the substrate protein and the UBE2I:SUMO
  thioester conjugate. The rates of some reactions are further enhanced by the action
  of other E3 ligases such as RANBP2. These E3 ligases catalyze SUMO transfer to substrate
  by one of two basic mechanisms: they interact with both the substrate and UBE2I:SUMO
  thus bringing them into proximity or they enhance the release of SUMO from UBE2I
  to the substrate.<br>In the cell SUMO1 is mainly concentrated at the nuclear membrane
  and in nuclear bodies. Most SUMO1 is conjugated to RANGAP1 near the nuclear pore.
  SUMO2 is at least partially cytosolic and SUMO3 is located mainly in nuclear bodies.
  Most SUMO2 and SUMO3 is unconjugated in unstressed cells and becomes conjugated
  to target proteins in response to stress (Golebiowski et al. 2009). Especially notable
  is the requirement for recruitment of SUMO to sites of DNA damage where conjugation
  to targets seems to coordinate the repair process (Flotho and Melchior 2013).<br>Several
  effects of SUMOylation have been described: steric interference with protein-protein
  interactions, interference with other post-translational modifications such as ubiquitinylation
  and phosphorylation, and recruitment of proteins that possess a SUMO-interacting
  motif (SIM) (reviewed in Zhao 2007, Flotho and Melchior 2013, Jentsch and Psakhye
  2013, Yang and Chiang 2013). In most cases SUMOylation inhibits the activity of
  the target protein.<br>The SUMOylation reactions included in this module have met
  two criteria: They have been verified by assays of individual proteins (as opposed
  to mass proteomic assays) and the effect of SUMOylation on the function of the target
  protein has been tested.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=3108232
