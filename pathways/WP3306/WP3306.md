description: Aflatoxins are among the principal mycotoxins produced as secondary metabolites
  by the molds Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus that contaminate economically
  important food and feed crops (Wild & Turner 2002). Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most
  potent naturally occurring carcinogen known and is also an immunosuppressant. It
  is a potent hepatocarcinogenic agent in many species, and has been implicated in
  the etiology of human hepatocellular carcinoma. Poultry, especially turkeys, are
  extremely sensitive to the toxic and carcinogenic action of AFB1 present in animal
  feed, resulting in multi-million dollar losses to the industry. Discerning the biochemical
  and molecular mechanisms of this extreme sensitivity of poultry to AFB1 will help
  with the development of new strategies to increase aflatoxin resistance (Rawal et
  al. 2010, Diaz & Murcia 2011).<br><br><br>AFB1 has one major genotoxic metabolic
  fate, conversion to AFXBO, and several others that are less mutagenic but that can
  still be quite toxic. AFB1 can be oxidised to the toxic AFB1 exo 8,9 epoxide (AFXBO)
  product by several cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially P450 3A4 in the liver. This
  8,9 epoxide can react with the N7 atom of a guanyl base of DNA to produce adducts
  by intercalating between DNA base pairs. The exo epoxide is unstable in solution,
  however, and can react spontaneously to form a diol that is no longer reactive with
  DNA. The diol product in turn undergoes base-catalysed rearrangement to a dialdehyde
  that can react with protein lysine residues. AFB1 can also be metabolised to products
  (AFQ1, AFM1, AFM1E) which have far less genotoxic consequences than AFB1. The main
  route of detoxification of AFB1 is conjugation of its reactive 8,9-epoxide form
  with glutathione (GSH). This reaction is carried out by trimeric glutathione transferases
  (GSTs), providing a chemoprotective mechanism against toxicity. Glutathione conjugates
  are usually excreted as mercapturic acids in urine (Guengerich et al. 1998, Hamid
  et al. 2013). The main metabolic routes of aflatoxin in humans are described here.  View
