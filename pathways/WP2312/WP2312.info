description: Arabidopsis thaliana is an annual facultative long-day plant. The correct timing of flowering is a key adaptive trait in all plants to ensure reproduction. A complex genetic network comprising numerous environmentally and endogenously controlled factors control the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. Important pathways responding to environmental cues are the vernalization and the photoperiod pathways whereas the autonomous, gibberellin, age, sugar metabolism, and circadian clock pathways react to endogenous signals. Several floral integrator genes to which the various pathways lead govern the transition from a vegetative to a floral meristem.
