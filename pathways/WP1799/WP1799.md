description: Optimal activation of T-lymphocytes requires at least two signals. A
  primary one is delivered by the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex after antigen recognition
  and additional costimulatory signals are delivered by the engagement of costimulatory
  receptors such as CD28. The best-characterized costimulatory pathways are mediated
  by a set of cosignaling molecules belonging to the CD28 superfamily, including CD28,
  CTLA4, ICOS, PD1 and BTLA receptors. These proteins deliver both positive and negative
  second signals to T-cells by interacting with B7 family ligands expressed on antigen
  presenting cells. Different subsets of T-cells have very different requirements
  for costimulation. CD28 family mediated costimulation is not required for all T-cell
  responses in vivo, and alternative costimulatory pathways also exist. Different
  receptors of the CD28 family and their ligands have different regulation of expression.
  CD28 is constitutively expressed on naive T cells whereas CTLA4 expression is dependent
  on CD28/B7 engagement and the other receptor members ICOS, PD1 and BTLA are induced
  after initial T-cell stimulation. <br>The positive signals induced by CD28 and ICOS
  molecules are counterbalanced by other members of the CD28 family, including cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte associated antigen (CTLA)4, programmed cell death (PD)1, and B and
  T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), which dampen immune responses. The balance of stimulatory
  and inhibitory signals is crucial to maximize protective immune responses while
  maintaining immunological tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. <br>The costimulatory
  receptors CD28, CTLA4, ICOS and PD1 are composed of single extracellular IgV-like
  domains, whereas BTLA has one IgC-like domain. Receptors CTLA4, CD28 and ICOS are
  covalent homodimers, due to an interchain disulphide linkage. The costimulatory
  ligands B71, B72, B7H2, B7H1 and B7DC, have a membrane proximal IgC-like domain
  and a membrane distal IgV-like domain that is responsible for receptor binding and
  dimerization. CD28 and CTLA4 have no known intrinsic enzymatic activity. Instead,
  engagement by their physiologic ligands B71 and B72 leads to the physical recruitment
  and activation of downstream T-cell effector molecules.  View original pathway at
