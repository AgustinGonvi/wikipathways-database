description: Dodecanoate, or lauric acid, is found in the fats and oils of both plants
  and animals, especially coconut and palm kernel oil. This pathway shows the degradation
  of dodecanoate leading to beta oxidation. Created by Magali Jaillard, Marijke Vermeer,
  Michiel Adrieans, Ron Schormans and Chris Evelo.  Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP206
