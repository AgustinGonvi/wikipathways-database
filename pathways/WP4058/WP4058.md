description: Steroid hormone receptors (SHR) are transcription factors that become
  activated upon sensing steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids,
  progesterone, androgens, or estrogen (Escriva et al 2000; Griekspoor A et al. 2007;
  Eick GN & Thornton JW. 2011). Depending on SHR type and the presence of ligand,
  they show different subcellular localizations. Whereas both unliganded and liganded
  estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) are predominantly nuclear, unliganded glucocorticoid
  (GR) and androgen receptors (AR) are mostly located in the cytoplasm and completely
  translocate to the nucleus only after binding hormone (Htun H et al. 1999; Stenoien
  D et al. 2000; Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell CM et al. 1995;
  Kumar S et al. 2006). The unliganded mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is partially
  cytoplasmic but can be found in nucleus in the ligand-bound or ligand-free form
  (Nishi M & Kawata M 2007). The progesterone receptor (PR) exists in two forms (PRA
  and PRB) with different ratios of nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of the
  unliganded receptor. In most cell contexts, the PRA isoform is a repressor of the
  shorter PRB isoform, and without hormone induction it is mostly located in the nucleus,
  whereas PRB distributes both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Lim CS et al.
  1999; Griekspoor A et al. 2007). In the absence of ligand, members of the steroid
  receptor family remain sequestered in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus in the complex
  with proteins of HSP70/HSP90 chaperone machinery (Pratt WB & Dittmar KD1998). The
  highly dynamic ATP-dependent interactions of SHRs with HSP90 complexes regulate
  SHR cellular location, protein stability, competency to bind steroid hormones and
  transcriptional activity (Echeverria PC & Picard D 2010). Understanding the mechanism
  of ATPase activity of HSP90 is mostly based on structural and functional studies
  of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 complexes (Meyer P et al. 2003, 2004; Ali
  MM et al. 2006; Prodromou C et al. 2000; Prodromou C 2012). The ATPase cycle of
  human HSP90 is less well understood, however several studies suggest that the underlying
  enzymatic mechanisms and a set of conformational changes that accompany the ATPase
  cycle are highly similar in both species (Richter K et al. 2008; Vaughan CK et al.
  2009). Nascent SHR proteins are chaperoned by HSP70 and HSP40 to HSP90 cycle via
  STIP1 (HOP) (and its TPR domains) (HernÃ¡ndez MP et al. 2002a,b; EcheverriaPC &
  Picard D 2010; Li J et al. 2011). The ATP-bound form of HSP90 leads to the displacement
  of STIP1 by immunophilins FKBP5 or FKBP4 resulting in conformational changes that
  allow efficient hormone binding (Li J et al. 2011). PTGES3 (p23) binds to HSP90
  complex finally stabilizing it in the conformation with a high hormone binding affinity.
  After hydrolysis of ATP the hormone bound SHR is released from HSP90 complex. The
  cytosolic hormone-bound SHR can be transported to the nucleus by several import
  pathways such as the dynein-based nuclear transport along microtubules involving
  the transport of the entire HSP90 complex or nuclear localization signals (NLS)-mediated
  nuclear targeting by importins (Tyagi RK et al. 2000; Cadepond F et al. 1992; Jewell
  CM et al. 1995; Kumar S et al. 2006). It is worth noting that GR-importin interactions
  can be ligand-dependent or independent (Freedman & Yamamoto 2004; Picard & Yamamoto
  1987). In the nucleus ligand-activated SHR dimerizes, binds specific sequences in
  the DNA, called Hormone Responsive Elements (HRE), and recruits a number of coregulators
  that facilitate gene transcription. Nuclear localization is essential for SHRs to
  transactivate their target genes, but the same receptors also possess non-genomic
  functions in the cytoplasm.<p>The Reactome module describes the ATPase-driven conformational
  cycle of HSP90 that regulates ligand-dependent activation of SHRs.  View original
