description: 'Yeast cells contain 3 pathways for the synthesis of glutamate.  Two
  pathways are mediated by two isoforms of glutamate dehydrogenase, encoded by GDH1
  and GDH3 (CITS: [2989290])(CITS: [9287019]).  The third pathway is driven by the
  combined activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, encoded by GLN1
  and GLT1, respectively (CITS: [2570348])(CITS: [8923741]).  Studies of GDH1 and
  GDH3 regulation indicate that the cell uses these isoforms under different growth
  conditions (CITS: [11562373]).  Expression of GDH3 is induced by ethanol and repressed
  by glucose, whereas GDH1 expression is high in either carbon source.  Gdh1p uses
  alpha-ketoglutarate at a higher rate than Gdh3p.  Thus, under fermentative growth
  conditions, Gdh1p drives glutamate biosynthesis, whereas in nonfermentable or limiting
  carbon sources, Gdh3p is the key isoform involved in balancing distribution of alpha-ketoglutarate
  to glutamate biosynthesis and energy metabolism.  SOURCE: SGD pathways, http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html'
