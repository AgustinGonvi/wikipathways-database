14-3-3	GeneProduct	F52D10.3	WormBase	
DAF-18/PTEN	GeneProduct	T07A9.6	WormBase	daf-18 functions upstream to akt-1 and akt-2</br>daf-18 acts downstream of age-1
PIP2	Metabolite	CHEBI:18348	ChEBI	
DAF-2/InR	GeneProduct	Y55D5A.5	WormBase	insulin/IGF-1 pathway can diverge to regulate the timing of reproduction independently of longevity (Dillin et al., 2002a).
PIP3	Metabolite	CHEBI:16618	ChEBI	
PDK-1/PKD1	GeneProduct	H42K12.1	WormBase	
AKT-1/Akt/PKB	GeneProduct	C12D8.10	WormBase	
AKT-2/Akt/PKB	GeneProduct	F28H6.1	WormBase	
DAF-16/FOXO	GeneProduct	R13H8.1	WormBase	PRMT-1 specifically methylates the C terminus of the forkhead domain (FH-C) in DAF-16 blocking binding to 14-3-3 protein.</br>DAF-16 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm as a result of inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues by the AKT and SGK kinases.</br>T242 is an AKT-mediated phosphorylation site in DAF-16
JNK-1	GeneProduct	B0478.1	WormBase	DAF-16 binds to JNK-1.</br>JNK-1 binds and phosphorylates DAF-16.
DAF-16/FOXO	GeneProduct	R13H8.1	WormBase	
JKK-1	GeneProduct	F35C8.3	WormBase	
PRMT-1	GeneProduct	Y113G7B.17	WormBase	
DAF-16/FOXO	GeneProduct	R13H8.1	WormBase	DAF-16 bound directly to PRMT-1 in  in vitro pulldown assays , HA-PRMT-1 was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-DAF-16 only when the both proteins were coexpressed.</br>
DAF-16/FOXO	GeneProduct	R13H8.1	WormBase	
RLE-1	GeneProduct	M142.6	WormBase	age-1 encodes a homologue of mammalian phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase catalytic subunit.</br>RLE-1 physically interacts with DAF-16.  RLE-1 C terminus is required for the interaction of RLE-1 with DAF-16.
SMK-1	GeneProduct	F41E6.4	WormBase	SMK-1 was temporally and spatially colocalized with active DAF-16.</br>smk-1 RNAi does not cause a general sickness in long-lived animals but rather specifically affects IIS-regulated life span.</br>DAF-16 and SMK-1 do not directly or indirectly regulate expression or localization of one another.</br>SMK-1 specifies the longevity function of DAF-16 by affecting the efficiency of transcription of DAF-16 target genes involved in oxidative and UV stress response and innate immunity but is not required for DAF-16 regulation of heat-stress-response genes.
SGK-1	GeneProduct	W10G6.2	WormBase	DAF-16 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm as a result of inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues by the AKT and SGK kinases.
daf-15	GeneProduct	C10C5.6	WormBase	Reduced smk-1 resulted in increased expression of daf-15 mRNA, suggesting that SMK-1 is required for the transcriptional repressor activity of DAF-16
DAF-16/FOXO	GeneProduct	R13H8.1	WormBase	PRMT-1 specifically methylates the C terminus of the forkhead domain (FH-C) in DAF-16 blocking binding to 14-3-3 protein.</br>DAF-16 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm as a result of inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues by the AKT and SGK kinases.</br>T242 is an AKT-mediated phosphorylation site in DAF-16
