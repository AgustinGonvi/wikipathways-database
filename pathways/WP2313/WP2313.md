description: Aging in C. elegans involves measurable declines in morphology, reproduction,
  and behavior.  Understanding the cellular and molecular processes leading to senescence
  in this nematode began in the early 1980s with the targeted identification of mutants
  that extended life span (an AGE phenotype). These studies identified at least two
  key regulators of life span, DAF-2, an insulin/IGF receptor ortholog, and DAF-16,
  a Forkhead-related transcription factor. Since then many more genes and pathways
  involved in senescence have been identified. Almost all of these genes play important
  roles in cellular and organismal-level processes other than aging, such as dauer
  formation, stress response, feeding, and chemosensation.
