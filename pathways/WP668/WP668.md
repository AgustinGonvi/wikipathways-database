description: Plant oxylipins are a diverse class of lipid metabolites that are derived
  from the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. Oxylipins formed in plants include
  fatty acid hydroperoxides, hydroxy-, oxo-, or keto-fatty acids, divinyl ethers,
  volatile aldehydes, or the plant hormone Jasmonic Acid (JA).
