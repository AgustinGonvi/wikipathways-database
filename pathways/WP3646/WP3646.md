description: 'Pathway model based on hub miRNAs and their putative targets from network
  analysis. * From a set of differentially expressed genes in both chronic HCV (hepatitis
  C virus) and HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) samples, a protein-protein network was
  constructed using STRING (http://string-db.org/) and GeneMANIA (http://genemania.org/).
  * After topological analysis and network visualization in Cytoscape, the top hub
  genes were identified. * miRNAs related to hub genes were identified using miRTarBase
  server and combined with the PPI network to constructed a miRNA-Hubgene network.  Based
  on Figure 4 from Poortahmasebi et al, How Hepatitis C Virus Leads to Hepatocellular
  Carcinoma: A Network-Based Study.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3646 CPTAC
