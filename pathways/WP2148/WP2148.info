Description: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a growth factor found in the central and peripheral nervous systems. BDNF binds to two well-characterized receptors, TrkB and p75 (aka, low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) to influence neuronal cell survival and differentiation. In the hippocampus, BDNF activity is also implicated in learning and memory.
