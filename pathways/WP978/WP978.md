description: 'Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also known as ErbB1/HER1 is
  a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases  which also includes ErbB2
  (Neu, HER2), ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4). Several ligands such as epidermal growth
  factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, epigen,  amphiregulin, betacellulin, heparin-binding
  EGF and epiregulin are known to specifically bind to EGFR. Epidermal growth factor
  (EGF) is one of the high affinity  ligands of EGFR. EGF/EGFR system induces growth,
  differentiation, migration, adhesion and cell survival through various inter-acting
  signaling pathways. The binding of  EGF to the extracellular domain of EGFR induces
  the dimerization, activation of intrinsic kinase activity and subsequent autophosphorylation
  of EGFR at multiple residues  in the cytoplasmic region such as Tyr 1092, Tyr 1172,
  Tyr 1197, Tyr 1110, Tyr 1016). Activated EGFR recruits various cytoplasmic proteins
  which transduce and regulate the  EGFR function. The proteins recruited to active
  EGFR include many Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain
  containing proteins which binds to the  tyrosine phosphorylated residues in EGFR,
  enzymes which act on EGFR and also various EGFR substrates. One of the adapter proteins,
  GRB2, binds to the phosphotyrosine  residue at 1068 and recruits SOS to the membrane.
  SOS activates GDP/GTP exchange which recruits RAF to the membrane. RAF phosphorylates
  MEKs, which then activates the  extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). ERK
  activates a number of transcriptional regulators to induce cell growth and proliferation.
  GRB2 or other adaptor proteins  such as GABs recruits PI3Ks, another major mediator
  of EGFR signaling. PI3Ks convert Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to
  Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).  PIP3 binds to PH domain of AKT
  and recruits it to plasma membrane. PDK1 phosphorylates AKT which in turn regulate
  the activity of various proteins that mediate cell  survival. EGFR also activate
  phospholipase C which hydrolyses PIP2 to generate Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and
  1,2-Diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces the release of Ca2+  from endoplasmic reticulum
  to activate calcium regulated pathways. DAG activates protein kinase C pathway.
  One of the signaling modules regulated by PKC in EGFR pathway is  the NFKB module.
  The protein SRC is a key player in the activation of various pathways such as RAS,
  PLC and also the STAT proteins in various cells. Other signaling modules  activated
  by EGFR include the FAK, JNK, p38MAPK and ERK5 modules. EGFR induces the JNK pathway
  through the activation of G proteins such as RAC and CDC42 which recruits JNK  kinases
  as well as regulate the actin polymerization.  EGFR also translocates from the plasma  membrane
  to other cellular compartments including nucleus where it directly  regulate the
  expression of several genes in cooperation with other transcriptional regulators
  such as STATs, PCNA and E2F family of proteins. Being a growth, differentiation  and
  cell survival factor; mutations and overexpression of EGFR and also the defective
  regulation of its signal transduction pathways has been established to be associated  with
  oncogenesis. Thus, EGFR and its signaling components are promising targets for effective
  therapy for various cancers. There are several proteins which have been reported  to
  regulate the EGFR signaling such as CBL, CSK, PKC and PTEN which promotes endocytosis
  or reduction in the EGFR activity or its signaling mediators. The major endocytic
  pathway  of EGFR is established to be the clathrin coated pits which delivers them
  to endosomes. The endosomal pathway recycles the membraneous form of EGFR or form
  multivesicular bodies (MVB)  and fuse with lysosomes for to the degradation pathway.   Please
