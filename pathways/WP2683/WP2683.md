description: 'For centuries influenza epidemics have plagued man; with influenza probably
  being the disease described by Hippocrates in 412 BC. Today it remains a major cause
  of morbidity and mortality worldwide with large segments of the human population
  affected every year. Many animal species can be infected by influenza viruses, often
  with catastrophic consequences. An influenza pandemic is a continuing global level
  threat. The 1918 influenza pandemic is a modern example of how devastating such
  an event could be with an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide.<p>  Influenza viruses
  belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae; viruses with segmented RNA genomes that
  are negative sense and single-stranded (Baltimore 1971). Influenza virus strains
  are named according to their type (A, B, or C), the species from which the virus
  was isolated (omitted if human), location of isolate, the number of the isolate,
  the year of isolation, and in the case of influenza A viruses, the hemagglutinin
  (H) and neuraminidase (N) subtype. For example, the virus of H5N1 subtype isolated
  from chickens in Hong Kong in 1997 is: influenza A/chicken/Hong Kong/220/97(H5N1)
  virus. Currently 16 different hemagglutinin (H1 to H16) subtypes and 9 different
  neuraminidase (N1 to N9) subtypes are known for influenza A viruses. Most human
  disease is due to influenza viruses of the A type. The events of influenza infection
  have been annotated in Reactome primarily use protein and genome references to the
  Influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 strain.   The influenza virus particle
  initially associates with a human host cell by binding to sialic acid receptors
  on the host cell surface. Sialic acids are found on many vertebrate cells and numerous
  viruses make use of this ubiquitous receptor. The bound virus is endocytosed by
  one of four distinct mechanisms. Once endocytosed the low endosomal pH sets in motion
  a number of steps that lead to viral membrane fusion mediated by the viral hemagglutinin
  (HA) protein, and the eventual release of the uncoated viral ribonucleoprotein complex
  into the cytosol of the host cell. The ribonucleoprotein complex is transported
  through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the incoming negative-sense
  viral RNA (vRNA) is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by a primer-dependent
  mechanism. Replication occurs via a two step process. A full-length complementary
  RNA (cRNA), a positive-sense copy of the vRNA, is first made and this in turn is
  used as a template to produce more vRNA. The viral proteins are expressed and processed
  and eventually assemble with vRNAs at what will become the budding sites on the
  host cell membrane. The viral protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes are assembled
  into complete viral particles and bud from the host cell, enveloped in the host
  cell''s membrane.<p>  Infection of a human host cell with influenza virus triggers
  an array of defensive host processes. This coevolution has driven the development
  of host processes that interfere with viral replication, notably the production
  of type I interferon. At the some time the virus counters these responses with the
  viral NS1 protein playing a central role in the viral response to the host cells
  defense.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=168255
