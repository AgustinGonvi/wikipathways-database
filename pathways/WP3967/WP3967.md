description: 'Summary of findings for miR-509-3p and the YAP1/ECM axis. Reference:
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041955/ Collectively, the results
  suggest that miR-509-3p-mediated changes in levels of YAP1 and ECM genes impair
  migration, invasion, and spheroid formation and so may attenuate metastatic progression
  in advanced stage ovarian cancer. Further, results suggest that the direct downstream
  miR-509-3p target YAP1 is likely a critical driver of cellular migration and spheroid
  formation in ovarian cancers in which levels of YAP1 protein are high.   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3967
  CPTAC Assay Portal].'
