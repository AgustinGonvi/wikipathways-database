description: Urea cycle disorders are caused by enzyme or transporter defects in the
  Urea cycle (WP4571). These diseases are characterised by hyperammonemia, respiratory
  alkalosis and encephalopathy and the severity of the disease depends on the severity
  of the defect and the place of the defect in the cycle. Severe forms usually have
  an onset in infancy, while mild forms can also present in adulthood. The diagnosis
  of Urea cycle disorders is based on altered concentrations of different metabolic
  biochemical markers. Some of these markers are metabolites in the Urea cycle, but
  there are also several other markers, that are either indirectly or not related
  to the Urea cycle. All metabolic markers used for the diagnosis of at least one
  Urea cycle disorder and their relations are visualized in this pathway.  Biochemical
  markers derived from http://www.iembase.org/, for all diseases pictured in WP4571
