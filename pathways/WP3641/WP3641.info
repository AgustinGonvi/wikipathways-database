Description: "Escherichia coli (E. Coli) contains a specific acyltransferase that derivatizes UDP-GlcNAc, which is the first obligatory reaction in the formation of lipid A (1-3), a unique glucosamine-based phospholipid that makes up the outer monolayer of the outer membrane of gramnegative bacteria." (rephrased from Anderson et al (1993)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8366124] ).
