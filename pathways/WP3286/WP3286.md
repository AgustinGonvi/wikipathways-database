description: Copper is a redox-active transition metal and an essential trace element
  for life. It is a catalytic cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in critical biological
  processes (eg. detoxyfication by oxygen free radicals, angiogenesis, pigmentation,
  peptide hormone production, etc.). However, "free" copper is harmful for cells because
  can generate ROS that leads to cellular damage. Thus, all organisms and cells maintain
  a tight control of its uptake, trafficking and export. This process is rather intricate
  and requires an interplay between numerous biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, metabolites...)
  that act as copper ions importers (CTR1, CTR2, DMT1, Prp, APP), chaperones (CCS,
  ATOX1, COX17, COMMD1) and exporters (ATP7A, ATP7B). Copper ions and Cu-indipendent
  stimuli (hormone, oxygen, phosphorylation and ubiquination) seem to affect localization
  and expression of Cu-transporters and chaperones. Potential target of copper ions
  seem to be crucial signaling pathways, such PI3K/Akt, in which copper induces insulin-like
  effects. Copper dyshomeostasis could be implicated in cancer and a number of neurodegenerative
  diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease and
  ALS.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3286
