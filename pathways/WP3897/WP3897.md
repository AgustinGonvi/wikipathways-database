description: 'Dengue virus infection can give rise to hemorrhagic shock. Highlighted
  in red are Dengue-2 structural protein interactions with human proteins involved
  in coagulation, building upon the canonical Blood Clotting Cascade described in
  http://wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP272 by the following text:  Coagulation
  is a complex process by which blood forms clots. It is an important part of hemostasis
  (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel), wherein a damaged blood vessel
  wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin-containing clot to stop bleeding and begin
  repair of the damaged vessel. Disorders of coagulation can lead to an increased
  risk of bleeding (hemorrhage) or clotting (thrombosis).  Source: [[wikipedia:Coagulation|Wikipedia]]'
