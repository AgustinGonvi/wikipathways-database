description: NFKB is an important transcription factor induced by multiple cellular
  mechanisms. This pathway diagram depicts the major activators of the pathway and
  the downsteam genes regulated by the pathway. Activation of growth factor receptors
  by growth factors or cellular stress leads to the activation of the Phosphatidyl
  Inositol-3 kinases (PI3Kinases). PI3 kinases phosphorylate the inositol ring of
  Phosphatidyl inositol to produce Phosphatidyl inositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3).
  PIP3 activates downstream serine-threonine protein kinases such as Protein kinase
  B (AKT/PKB) through the kinase PDK1. Activation of Akt is tightly regulated by the
  quantity of the second messenger phosphatidyl inositol triphosphate.(PIP3). AKT
  itself can be dephosphorylated by the action of protein phosphatases. AKT contributes
  to several cellular functions including inhibition of apoptosis and cell survival,
  nutrient metabolism, cell growth, transcriptional regulation. AKT inhibits apoptosis
  by the phosphorylated inhibition of BAD and caspase 9. AKT phosphorylates and inactivates
  the enzyme glycogen synthetase kinase 3 and activates the transcription of glucose
  transporter (GLUT 1) and the glycolytic enzyme Phospho-fructo-2-kinase. AKT activates
  the NFΚΒ pathway through direct activation of IΚK and through phosphorylation of
  the MAP3kinase Tpl2. Activation of the NFΚΒ pathway also occurs through trans-membrane
  receptor complexes (TNF receptor superfamily, IL-1 receptor and the Toll like receptor
  family). Hypoxia, reactive oxygen species and cytokines such as TNF alpha and IL-1
  activate the NFΚΒ pathway through these receptors. NFΚΒ elements are usually present
  in the cytoplasm as homo or heterodimers. They are localised to the cytoplasm by
  being complexed to proteins called the Inhibitors of Kappa beta (IΚΒ). Activation
  of the NFΚΒ pathway involves the breakdown of these complexes by proteosomal degradation
  of the IΚΒ subunits and translocation of the NFΚΒ elements into the nucleus. This
  is catalyzed by the action of protein kinases called the inhibitors of kappa kinase
  (IΚK) complex. In the nucleus NFΚΒ elements induce the transcription of genes related
  to cytokines, cell surface receptors, pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins,
  adhesion molecules and anti-oxidants. NFΚΒ pathway is regulated by several feedback
  loops including increased transcription of the Iκβε gene in response to NFΚΒ activation.
