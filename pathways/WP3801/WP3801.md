description: About half of the rRNA genes in the genome are actively expressed, being
  transcribed by RNA polymerase I (reviewed in Nemeth and Langst 2008, Bartova et
  al. 2010, Goodfellow and Zomerdijk 2012, Grummt and Langst 2013). As inferred from
  mouse, those genes that are expressed are activated by ERCC6 (also known as Cockayne
  Syndrome protein, CSB) which interacts with TTF-I bound to the T0 terminator region
  (also know as the Sal Box) of rRNA genes (Yuan et al. 2007, reviewed in Birch and
  Zomerdijk 2008, Grummt and Langst 2013). ERCC6 recruits the histone methyltransferase
  EHMT2 (also known as G9a) which dimethylates histone H3 at lysine-9 in the coding
  region of rRNA genes. The dimethylated lysine is bound by CBX3 (also known as Heterochromatic
  Protein-1gamma, HP1gamma) and increases expression of the rRNA gene. Continuing
  dimethylation depends on continuing transcription. Mutations in CSB result in dysregulation
  of RNA polymerase I transcription, which plays a role in the symptoms of Cockayne
  Syndrome (reviewed in Hannan et al. 2013).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=427389
