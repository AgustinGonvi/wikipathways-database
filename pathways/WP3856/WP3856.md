description: The presence P. berghei signals proteins Toll Pathway through proteins
  PGRP-S, CLIPB13, CLIPC8, and SPZ2. Toll activates death domain-containing molecules
  (MyD88, Tube, Pelle). Pellino ubiquinates Pelle which allows TRAF to activate REL1
  by the ubiquitination of cactus. REL1 translocates to nucleus to upregulate immune
  genes. The IMD pathway is activated by presence of P. faciparum that starts a cascade
  of activation of Fadd, Dredd, Tak1/Tab2 coomplex and leads to the activation, translocation,
  and effector gene promotion of Relish. The Effete/Uev1a/Bendless/IAP2 inhibits the
  CASPL1/Dredd complex. The JAK/STAT pathway is activated by presence of P. vivax
  and unpaired gene particles binding to dome/JAK/STAT complex leading to the actIvation
  of the STAT complex which translocates to the nucleus to promote transcription of
  effector genes. This pathway was taken from Figure 2B of Severo et al.
