description: REV-ERBA binds DNA elements very similar to those bound by the transcription
  activator RORA.  RORAREV-ERBA bound to DNA and heme recruits the corepressors NCoR
  and HDAC3 to repress transcription. Thus REV-ERBA and RORA appear to compete to
  repress or activate genes, repectively.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1368071
