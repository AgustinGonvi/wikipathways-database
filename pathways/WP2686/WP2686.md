description: Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs, SREBFs) respond to
  low cholesterol concentrations by transiting to the nucleus and activating genes
  involved in cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis (reviewed in Brown and Goldstein
  2009, Osborne and Espenshade 2009, Weber et al. 2004).<br> Newly synthesized SREBPs
  are transmembrane proteins that bind SCAP in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane.
  SCAP binds cholesterol which causes a conformational change that allows SCAP to
  interact with INSIG, retaining the SCAP:SREBP complex in the ER. INSIG binds oxysterols,
  which cause INSIG to bind SCAP and retain SCAP:SREBP in the endoplasmic reticulum.<br>In
  low cholesterol (below about 5 mol%) SCAP no longer interacts with cholesterol or
  INSIG and binds Sec24 of the CopII coat complex instead. Thus SCAP:SREBP transits
  with the CopII complex from the ER to the Golgi. In the Golgi SREBP is cleaved by
  S1P and then by S2P, releasing the N-terminal fragment of SREBP into the cytosol.
  The N-terminal fragment is imported to the nucleus by importin-beta and then acts
  with other factors, such as SP1 and NF-Y, to activate transcription of target genes.
  Targets of SREBP include the genes encoding all enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis
  and several genes involved in lipogenesis. SREBP2 most strongly activates cholesterol
  biosynthesis while SREBP1C most strongly activates lipogenesis.  View original pathway
