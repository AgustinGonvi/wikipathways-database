description: 'Vitamine B6 is absorbed in different vitamers, which undergo several
  (de)phosphorylation steps, to be able to pas the blood-brain barrier. Within the
  brain, PLP (Pyridoxal-P) is the only active cofactor for intracellular enzyme reactions.
  PLP catalyses over 100 reactions, mainly related to amino acids and neurotransmitter
  metabolism. Bold lines in the Figure show how the major source of PLP is divided
  in the body. A number of genetic defects have been identified as the underlying
  cause of vitamine B6 dependent epilepsies, particularly occurring in the neonatal
  life stage, which could lead to irreversible brain damage or could be fatal.  The
  disorders related to this pathway can be divided in two categories: reduced production/availability
  of PLP or inactivation of PLP by formation of Knoevenagel products. Specific biomarkers
  from urine, plasma or Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) exist to distinguish the disorders.
  Oral treatment with PL or PLP is available, as well as intrauterine treatment with
  vitamine B6 for mothers in the early stages of pregnancy.  This pathway was inspired
  by Chapter 11 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).'
