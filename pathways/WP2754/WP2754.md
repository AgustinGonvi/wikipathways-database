description: The neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft released by the pre-synaptic
  neuron binds specific receptors located on the post-synaptic terminal. These receptors
  are either ion channels or G protein coupled receptors that function to transmit
  the signals from the post-synaptic membrane to the cell body.  View original pathway

  - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR) are ionotropic receptors that can be
    activated by nicotine and permeable to of monovalent (sodium, potassium) and divalent
    cations(calcium), however, the permeability of sodium and/or calcium maybe high
    or low depending on the subunit composition of the receptor. Nicotinic acetylcholine
    receptors are expressed widely in the central and peripheral nervous system in
    the presynaptic terminal, terminal bouton and post synaptic neuron. Functionally
    nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the pre synaptic and postsynaptic terminals
    behave similarly. Nicotinic AChR are a family of acetylcholine gated pentameric
    receptors that are formed by the association of various combinations of mostly
    alpha, beta subunits (for the neuronal type) and together with gamma, delta and
    epsilon subunits (for the muscle type). In addition, receptors may be more diverse
    due the fact that some receptors have same subunits but the stoichiometry of the
    subunits is different.
