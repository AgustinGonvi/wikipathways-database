  "description": "Endothelial dysfunction and vascular insulin resistance usually coexist and chronic inflammation engenders both. Salicylate treatment fully inhibited vascular inflammation, prevented microvascular insulin resistance and significantly improved muscle metabolic responses to insulin. Insulin resistance and inflammation play an essential role in the process of microvascular insuline resistance. This study was performed on rats; a (+) or (-) indicates a change in regulation, due to high fat diet induced diabetes mellitus.",
