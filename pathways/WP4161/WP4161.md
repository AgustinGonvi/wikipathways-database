description: Endothelial dysfunction and vascular insulin resistance usually coexist
  and chronic inflammation engenders both. Salicylate treatment fully inhibited vascular
  inflammation, prevented microvascular insulin resistance and significantly improved
  muscle metabolic responses to insulin. Insulin resistance and inflammation play
  an essential role in the process of microvascular insuline resistance. This study
  was performed on rats; a (+) or (-) indicates a change in regulation, due to high
  fat diet induced diabetes mellitus.
