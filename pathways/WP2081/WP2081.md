description: Smooth muscle cells exhibit a unique plasticity, in that they are able
  to oscillate between proliferative and more quiescent, differentiated states. These
  two states are determined, in part, by a network of transcription factors, including
  Klf-4, Elk-1 and serum response factor (SRF), that regulate expression of genes
  controlling smooth muscle cell status. Two smooth muscle-enriched, co-transcribed
  microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-143 and miR-145, cooperatively target this transcription
  factor network to promote smooth muscle cell differentiation. miR-145 also acts
  in a positive feed-foward regulatory loop to enhance expression of the smooth muscle
  regulator, Myocardin (Myocd), which cooperates with SRF to activate transcription
  of miR-143/145. Conversely, the cardiac and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA, miR-133,
  which is also under transcriptional control of both SRF and Mef2C, acts in a negative
  feed-back loop to decrease SRF translation. Other miRNAs, including miR-214 and
  miR-199a, also target SRF, limiting its activity in specific cell types.
