description: Gap junctions are clusters of intercellular channels connecting adjacent
  cells and permitting the direct exchange of ions and small molecules between cells.
  These channels are composed of two hemichannels, or connexons,  one located on each
  of  the two neighboring cells.  Each connexon is composed of 6  trans-membrane protein
  subunits of the connexin (Cx) family.  A gap of approximately 3 nm remains between
  the adjacent cell membranes, but two connexons interact and dock head-to-head in
  the extra-cellular space forming a tightly sealed, double-membrane intercellular
  channel (see Segretain and Falk, 2004).  The activity of these intercellular channels
  is regulated, particularly by intramolecular modifications such as phosphorylation
  which appears to regulate connexin turnover, gap junction assembly and the opening
  and closure  (gating) of gap junction channels.   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=157858
