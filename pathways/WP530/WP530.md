description: 'Inflammation is a protective response to infection by the immune system
  that requires communication between different classes of immune cells to coordinate
  their actions. Acute inflammation is an important part of the immune response, but
  chronic inappropriate inflammation can lead to destruction of tissues in autoimmune
  disorders and perhaps neurodegenerative or cardiovascular disease. Secreted cytokine
  proteins provide signals between immune cells to coordinate the inflammatory response.
