description: 'The branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are
  all essential amino acids (i.e., ones required in the diet). They are major constituents
  of muscle protein. The breakdown of these amino acids starts with two common steps
  catalyzed by enzymes that act on all three amino acids: reversible transamination
  by branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, and irreversible oxidative decarboxylation
  by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Isovaleryl-CoA is produced
  from leucine by these two reactions, alpha-methylbutyryl-CoA from isoleucine, and
  isobutyryl-CoA from valine. These acyl-CoA''s undergo dehydrogenation, catalyzed
  by three different but related enzymes, and the breakdown pathways then diverge.
  Leucine is ultimately converted to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; isoleucine to acetyl-CoA
  and succinyl-CoA; and valine to succinyl-CoA. Under fasting conditions, substantial
  amounts of all three amino acids are generated by protein breakdown. In muscle,
  the final products of leucine, isoleucine, and valine catabolism can be fully oxidized
  via the citric acid cycle; in liver they can be directed toward the synthesis of
  ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA) and glucose (succinyl-CoA) (Neinast
  et al. 2019).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=70895
