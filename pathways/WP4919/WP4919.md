description: Neuroinflammation is inflammation specific to parts of the central nervous
  system. It can be triggered by external or internal factors, such as UV damage,
  inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Stress on the cell leads to activation
  of inflammatory response pathways that involve several transcription factors such
  as AP-1 and NFkB, which will lead to the transcription of several proteins and/or
  cytokines.
