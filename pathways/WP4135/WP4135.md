description: RNA polymerase III is one of three types of nuclear RNA polymerases present
  in eucaryotic cells.  About 10% of the total transcription in dividing cells can
  be attributed to its activity.  It synthesizes an eclectic collection of catalytic
  or structural RNA molecules, some of which are involved in protein synthesis, pre-mRNA
  splicing, tRNA processing, and the control of RNA polymerase II elongation, whereas
  some others have still unknown functions.  Like other RNA polymerases, RNA polymerase
  III cannot recognize its target promoters directly.  Instead it is recruited to
  specific promoter sequences through the help of transcription factors.  There are
  three basic types of RNA polymerase III promoters, called types 1, 2, and 3(Geiduschek
  and Kassavetis, 1992).  Although in vivo, RNA polymerase III may be recruited to
  these promoters as part of a large complex (holo RNA polymerase III) containing
  the polymerase and its initiation factors (Wang et al., 1997), in vitro the reaction
  can be divided into several steps.  First, the promoter elements are recognized
  by DNA binding factors, which then recruit a factor known as TFIIIB.  TFIIIB itself
  then directly contacts RNA polymerase III.  In human cells but not in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>,
  there are at least two versions of TFIIIB.  One contains TBP, Bdp1, and Brf1 (Brf1-TFIIIB),
  and the other TBP, Bdp1, and Brf2 (Brf2-TFIIIB) (Schramm et al., 2000; Teichmann
  et al., 2000).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=74158
