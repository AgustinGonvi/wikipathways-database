description: Metaphase is marked by the formation of the metaphase plate.  The metaphase plate is formed when the spindle fibers align the chromosomes along the middle of the cell.  Such an organization helps to ensure that later, when the chromosomes are separated, each new nucleus that is formed receives one copy of each chromosome. This pathway has not yet been annotated in Reactome.<br><br>The metaphase to anaphase transition during mitosis is triggered by the destruction of mitotic cyclins.<br><br>In anaphase, the paired chromosomes separate at the centromeres, and move to the opposite sides of the cell. The movement of the chromosomes is facilitated by a combination of kinetochore movement along the spindle microtubules and through the physical interaction of polar microtubules.
