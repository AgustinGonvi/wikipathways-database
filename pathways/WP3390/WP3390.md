description: 'Bacillus anthracis bacteria target cells in an infected human through
  the action of three secreted bacterial proteins, lef (also known as LF, lethal factor),
  cya (also known as EF, edema factor), and pagA (also known as PA, protective antigen)
  (Turk 2007; Young and Collier 2007). lef is a protease that cleaves and inactivates
  many MAP2K (MAP kinase kinase, MEK) proteins (Duesbery et al. 1998; Vitale et al.
  2000), disrupting MAP kinase signaling pathways. cya is an adenylate cyclase that
  mediates the constitutive production of cAMP (Leppla 1982), a molecule normally
  generated transiently in tightly regulated amounts in response to extracellular
  signals. Both lef and cya depend on pagA to enter their target cells, a strategy
  characteristic of bacterial binary toxins (Barth et al. 2004). pagA binds to the
  target cell receptors, is cleaved by furin or other cellular proteases, and thereupon
  forms an oligomer that exposes binding sites for lef and cya molecules (Young and
  Collier 2007). This complex is taken into the target cell by clathrin mediated endocytosis
  and delivered to endosomes. The low pH of the endosome causes the bacterial toxin
  complex to rearrange: the pagA oligomer forms a pore in the endosome membrane through
  which lef and cya molecules enter the target cell cytosol.  View original pathway
