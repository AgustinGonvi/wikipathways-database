description: Schematic summarizing predicted miR-517a relationships with ARCN1 and
  USP1.  A genomewide miRNA mimic toxicity screen indicates common and selective vulnerabilities
  of epithelial ovarian cancer cells. miR-517a targets a common vulnerability, primarily
  via its target ARCN1.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via
  the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3596 CPTAC Assay Portal].
