description: '"Regulation of immune responses in the epidermis by two largely parallel
  pathways. The p38 MAPK pathway (proteins in this pathway are in black letters) regulates
  the expression nlp-29, an AMP-encoding gene. A second AMP, encoded by cnc-2, is
  regulated by neuronally expressed dbl-1 that actives TGFb pathway (blue letters)
  in the epidermis. The identity of the neurones and whether G-protein signalling
  is required for neuronal secretion of DBL-1 is not known."'
