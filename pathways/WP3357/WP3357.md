description: Protein kinases N (PKN), also known as protein kinase C-related kinases
  (PKR) feature a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain and three RHO-binding
  motifs at the N-terminus. RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB, RHOC and RAC1 bind PKN1, PKN2
  and PKN3 (Maesaki et al. 1999, Zhong et al. 1999, Owen et al. 2003, Modha et al.
  2008, Hutchinson et al. 2011, Hutchinson et al. 2013), bringing them in proximity
  to the PIP3-activated co-activator PDPK1 (PDK1) (Flynn et al. 2000, Torbett et al.
  2003). PDPK1 phosphorylates PKNs on a highly conserved threonine residue in the
  kinase activation loop, which is a prerequisite for PKN activation. Phosphorylation
  of other residues might also be involved in activation (Flynn et al. 2000, Torbett
  et al. 2003, Dettori et al. 2009). PKNs are activated by fatty acids like arachidonic
  acid and phospholipids in vitro, but the in vivo significance of this activation
  remains unclear (Palmer et al. 1995, Yoshinaga et al. 1999).<p>PKNs play important
  roles in diverse functions, including regulation of cell cycle, receptor trafficking,
  vesicle transport and apoptosis. PKN is also involved in the ligand-dependent transcriptional
  activation by the androgen receptor. More than 20 proteins and several peptides
  have been shown to be phosphorylated by PKN1 and PKN2, including CPI-17 (Hamaguchi
  et al. 2000), alpha-actinin (Mukai et al. 1997), adducin (Collazos et al. 2011),
  CDC25C (Misaki et al. 2001), vimentin (Matsuzawa et al. 1997), TRAF1 (Kato et al.
  2008), CLIP170 (Collazos et al. 2011) and EGFR (Collazos et al. 2011). There are
  no known substrates for PKN3 (Collazos et al. 2011).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5625740
