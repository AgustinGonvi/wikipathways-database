Smooth
muscle/non-muscle
myosin II	Complex	R-HSA-419194	Reactome	Class 2 myosins are a set of protein complexes that bind actin and hydrolyse ATP, acting as molecular motors. They consist of two myosin heavy chains , two essential light chains and two regulatory light chains (MRLCs). Smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin isoforms are a subset of Class 2 myosin complexes. The nomenclature for isoforms is misleading, as non-muscle isoforms can be found in smooth muscle. The 4 smooth muscle isoforms all have heavy chains encoded by MYH11. The non-muscle isoforms have heavy chains encoded by MYH9, MYH10 or MYH14 (NMHC-IIA, B and C). The essential light chain (LC17) common to smooth and non-muscle isoforms is encoded by MYL6. The regulatory light chain (LC20) is encoded by either MYL9, giving a slightly more basic protein that is referred to as the smooth muscle LC20 isoform, and MRLC2, giving a more acidic isoform referred to as the non-muscle LC20 isoform.  

Class 2 myosins play a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, including cell migration, polarity formation, and cytokinesis.

Cell Cycle
Checkpoints	Pathway	R-HSA-69620	Reactome	A hallmark of the human cell cycle in normal somatic cells is its precision. This remarkable fidelity is achieved by a number of signal transduction pathways, known as checkpoints, which monitor cell cycle progression ensuring an interdependency of S-phase and mitosis, the integrity of the genome and the fidelity of chromosome segregation.<p>Checkpoints are layers of control that act to delay CDK activation when defects in the division program occur. As the CDKs functioning at different points in the cell cycle are regulated by different means, the various checkpoints differ in the biochemical mechanisms by which they elicit their effect. However, all checkpoints share a common hierarchy of a sensor, signal transducers, and effectors that interact with the CDKs.<p>The stability of the genome in somatic cells contrasts to the almost universal genomic instability of tumor cells. There are a number of documented genetic lesions in checkpoint genes, or in cell cycle genes themselves, which result either directly in cancer or in a predisposition to certain cancer types. Indeed, restraint over cell cycle progression and failure to monitor genome integrity are likely prerequisites for the molecular evolution required for the development of a tumor. Perhaps most notable amongst these is the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in >50% of human tumors.  Thus, the importance of the checkpoint pathways to human biology is clear.

PIP3 activates AKT
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-1257604	Reactome	Signaling by AKT is one of the key outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. AKT is activated by the cellular second messenger PIP3, a phospholipid that is generated by PI3K. In ustimulated cells, PI3K class IA enzymes reside in the cytosol as inactive heterodimers composed of p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1). Phosphorylation of both the threonine and the serine residue is required to fully activate AKT. The active AKT then dissociates from PIP3 and phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins that play important roles in cell survival and metabolism. For a recent review of AKT signaling, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007.

RHO GTPases activate
CIT	Pathway	R-HSA-5625900	Reactome	Citron kinase (CIT) or citron RHO-interacting kinase (CRIK) shares similarities with ROCK kinases. Like ROCK, it consists of a serine/threonine kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, a RHO-binding domain, a cysteine rich region and a plekstrin homology (PH) domain, but additionally features a proline-rich region and a PDZ-binding domain. A shorter splicing isoform of CIT, citron-N, is specifically expressed in the nervous system and lacks the kinase domain. Citron-N is a component of the post-synaptic density, where it binds to the PDZ domains of the scaffolding protein PDS-95/SAP90 (Zhang et al. 2006).<p>While the binding of CIT to RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOB, RHOC and RAC1 is well established (Madaule et al. 1995), the mechanism of CIT activation by GTP-bound RHO GTPases has not been elucidated. There are indications that CIT may be activated through autophosphorylation in the presence of active forms of RHO GTPases (Di Cunto et al. 1998). CIT appears to phosphorylate the myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), the only substrate identified to date, on the same residues that are phosphorylated by ROCKs, but it has not been established yet how this relates to activation by RHO GTPases (Yamashiro et al. 2003). CIT and RHOA are implicated to act together in Golgi apparatus organization through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Camera et al. 2003). CIT is also involved in the regulation of cytokinesis through its interaction with KIF14 (Gruneberg et al. 2006, Bassi et al. 2013, Watanabe et al. 2013) and p27(Kip1) (Serres et al. 2012).

Myosin phosphatase	Complex	R-HSA-419080	Reactome	All known myosin phosphatases consist of PP1 beta and both a large and a small myosin phosphatase targetting (Mypt) subunit. The large Mypt targets PP1 beta to myosin and determines the substrate specifity of the phosphatase. The Large Mypt subunit is encoded by one of three human genes, PPP1R12A (MYPT1), PPP1R12B (MYPT2) and PPP1R12C. Only MYPT1 is represented here. The small subunit is an alternative transcript of MYPT2. The function of the small Mypt subunit remains unclear, but because it is known to interact directly with myosin and the large Mypt it is thought to have an unspecified regulatory role.

p-T19,S20-MRLC-smooth muscle/non-muscle myosin II	Complex	R-HSA-419195	Reactome	Nonmuscle myosin II (NMM2) is an actin-based motor protein that plays a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, including smooth muscle contraction, cell migration, polarity formation, and cytokinesis. NMM2 consists of two myosin heavy chains encoded by MYH9, MYH10, MYH14 (NMHC-IIA, B and C) or MYH11, two copies of MYL6 essential light chain protein, and two regulatory light chains (MRLCs), MYL9 and MYL12B. Myosin II activity is stimulated by phosphorylation of MRLC. Diphosphorylation at Thr-19 and Ser-20 (commonly referred in the literature as Thr-18 and Ser-19) increases both actin-activated Mg2+ ATPase activity and the stability of myosin II filaments; monophosphorylation at Ser-20 is less effective (Ikebe and Hartshorne 1985, Ikebe et al. 1988). Kinases responsible for the phosphorylation include myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), ROCK kinase, citron kinase, myotonic dystrophy kinase-related CDC42-binding protein kinase, and Zipper-interacting protein (ZIP) kinase. ROCK activity has been shown to regulate MRLC phosphorylation by directly mono- or diphosphorylating MRLC (Amano et al., 1996, Ueda et al., 2002, Watanabe et al. 2007).
Activated PKN1
stimulates
transcription of AR
(androgen receptor)
regulated genes
KLK2 and KLK3	Pathway	R-HSA-5625886	Reactome	PKN1, activated by phosphorylation at threonine T774, binds activated AR (androgen receptor) and promotes transcription from AR-regulated promoters. On one hand, phosphorylated PKN1 promotes the formation of a functional complex of AR with the transcriptional coactivator NCOA2 (TIF2) (Metzger et al. 2003). On the other hand, binding of phosphorylated PKN1, in complex with the activated AR, to androgen-reponsive promoters of KLK2 and KLK3 (PSA) genes, leads to PKN1-mediated histone phosphorylation. PKN1-phosphorylated histones recruit histone demethylases KDM4C (JMJD2C) and KDM1A (LSD1), and the ensuing demethylation of histones associated with the promoter regions of KLK2 and KLK3 genes increases their transcription (Metzger et al. 2005, Metzger et al. 2008).

Mitotic G2-G2/M
phases	Pathway	R-HSA-453274	Reactome	Mitotic G2 (gap 2) phase is the second growth phase during eukaryotic mitotic cell cycle. G2 encompasses the interval between the completion of DNA synthesis and the beginning of mitosis. During G2, the cytoplasmic content of the cell increases. At G2/M transition, duplicated centrosomes mature and separate and CDK1:cyclin B complexes become active, setting the stage for spindle assembly and chromosome condensation that occur in the prophase of mitosis (O'Farrell 2001, Bruinsma et al. 2012, Jiang et al. 2014).
