description: The peptidoglycan layers of many gram-positive bacteria (such as Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae) are densely functionalized with anionic glycopolymers called wall teichoic
  acids (WTAs). These polymers play crucial roles in cell shape determination, regulation
  of cell division, and other fundamental aspects of gram-positive bacterial physiology.
  Additionally, WTAs are important in pathogenesis and play key roles in antibiotic
  resistance. Based on http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/biocyc/
