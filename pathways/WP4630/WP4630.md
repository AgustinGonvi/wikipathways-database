description: 'The measles virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense virus that exclusively
  infects humans. The measles virus has two surface proteins responsible for binding
  and fusion to target cells: hemagglutinin (H) and membrane fusion protein (F). Multiple
  receptors have been identified to bind these surface proteins: CD46, SLAM, Nectin-4
  and TLR. The viral proteins P, V and C suppress the innate immune response by inhibiting
  signaling for both type I IFN induction and JAK/STAT-mediated interferon-stimulated
  gene (ISG) induction. The virus also causes inhibition of IL-12 expression in dendritic
  cells, via H proteins on viral particles as well as N proteins from infected cells.  This
  pathway is based on [https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05162 KEGG].'
