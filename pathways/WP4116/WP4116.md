description: Synthesis of the disaccharide lactose takes place within the Golgi apparatus
  of epithelial cells of the lactating mammary gland. The synthesis itself is a single
  chemical reaction of free glucose and UDP-galactose to form lactose and UDP. For
  this reaction to occur, glucose is transported from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen,
  and B4GALT1 interacts with LALBA (alpha-lactalbumin) to modulate its substrate specificity
  (Brew and Hill 1975).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5653890
