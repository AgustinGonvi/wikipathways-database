description: Insulin binding to its receptor results in receptor autophosphorylation
  on tyrosine residues and the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates
  (e.g. IRS and Shc) by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase.  This allows association
  of IRSs with downstream effectors such as PI-3K via its Src homology 2 (SH2) domains
  leading to end point events such as Glut4 (Slc2a4) translocation.  Shc when tyrosine
  phosphorylated associates with Grb2 and can thus activate the Ras/MAPK pathway independent
  of the IRSs.<p>Signal transduction by the insulin receptor is not limited to its
  activation at the cell surface.  The activated ligand-receptor complex initially
  at the cell surface, is internalised into endosomes itself a process which is dependent
  on tyrosine autophosphorylation.  Endocytosis of activated receptors has the dual
  effect of concentrating receptors within endosomes and allows the insulin receptor
  tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate substrates that are spatially distinct from those
  accessible at the plasma membrane.  Acidification of the endosomal lumen, due to
  the presence of proton pumps, results in dissociation of insulin from its receptor.  (The
  endosome constitutes the major site of insulin degradation).   This loss of the
  ligand-receptor complex attenuates any further insulin-driven receptor re-phosphorylation
  events and leads to receptor dephosphorylation by extra-lumenal endosomally-associated
  protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The identity of these PTPs is not clearly
  established yet.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=74752
