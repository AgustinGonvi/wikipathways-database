description: 'Overview of purine metabolism and related diseases. Disorders resulting
  from an enzyme defect are highlighted in pink, metabolic markers are highlighted
  in red. Arrows indicate the directionality of chemical conversions.  On the right,
  the biosynthesis of IMP is depicted in more detail (adapted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine_metabolism).
  The color scheme for this part of the pathway is as follows: enzymes(black), coenzymes(light
  orange), regular substrates/metabolites(blue), additional substrates(dark green),
  metal ions(turquoise), inorganic molecules(light purple).  This pathway was inspired
  by Chapter 41 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)). A similar
  version without the disorders and with biomarkers visualised with arrows can be
  found [https://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP4792 here].  Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4224
