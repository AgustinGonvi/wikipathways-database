description: This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids Pathway expended
  pathway display [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php] and extended
  with the top left side of Figure 1 from Dennis and Norris (2015 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139350]).
  Eicosanoids are a large group of compounds metabolised from arachidonic acid (AA),
  either via cyclooxygenases (COX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4347],
  lipooxygenases(LOX)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4348], or cytochrome
  P450 monooxygenases (CYP)[https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4349].
  This pathway visualises the first route, via COX, where additonal colours have been
  used to visualise which conversions are being performed by the same enzymes. Green
  and orange boxes represent receptors, where the orange colour depicts peroxisome-proliferator
  activating receptors (PPARs) potentially activated by the eicosanoids.
