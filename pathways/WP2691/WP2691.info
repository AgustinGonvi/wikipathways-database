description: Peptide hormones are peptides that are secreted directly into the blood stream (endocrine hormones). They are synthesized as precursors that require proteolytic processing (not discussed here) to generate the biologically active peptides that mediate neurotransmission and hormonal action. Glycoprotein hormones (those which include carbohydrate side-chains) and the processing of corticotropin are annotated here.
