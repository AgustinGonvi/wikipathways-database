description: Peptide hormones are peptides that are secreted directly into the blood
  stream (endocrine hormones). They are synthesized as precursors that require proteolytic
  processing (not discussed here) to generate the biologically active peptides that
  mediate neurotransmission and hormonal action. Glycoprotein hormones (those which
  include carbohydrate side-chains) and the processing of corticotropin are annotated
  here.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=209952
