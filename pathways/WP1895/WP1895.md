description: Rap1 (Ras-proximate-1) is a small G protein in the Ras superfamily. Like
  all G proteins, Rap1 is activated when bound GDP is exchanged for GTP. Rap1 is targeted
  to lipid membranes by the covalent attachment of lipid moieties to its carboxyl
  terminus. Movement of Rap1 from endosomal membranes to the plasma membrane upon
  activation has been reported in several cell types including Jurkat T cells and
  megakaryocytes. On activation,  Rap1 undergoes conformational changes that facilitate
  recruitment of a variety of effectors, triggering it's participation in integrin
  signaling, ERK activation, and others.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=392517
