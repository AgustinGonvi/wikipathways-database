description: '"The PPARGC1A protein is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates
  the genes involved in energy metabolism. This protein interacts with the nuclear
  receptor PPARG, which permits the interaction of this protein with multiple transcription
  factors. This protein can interact with, and regulate the activities of, cAMP response
  element binding protein (CREB) and nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs). It provides
  a direct link between external physiological stimuli and the regulation of mitochondrial  biogenesis,
  and is a major factor that regulates muscle fiber type determination. This protein
  may be also involved in controlling blood pressure, regulating cellular cholesterol
  homoeostasis, and the development of obesity."  Description source: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:PPARGC1A]])  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1541
