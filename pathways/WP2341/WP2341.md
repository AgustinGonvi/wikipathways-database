description: Thiamin, in its active form thiamin diphosphate (ThDP), is the cofactor
  for transketolases, decarboxylases, and other enzymes that make or break C-C bonds.
  Thiamin contains pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are synthesized separately
  in plastids and then coupled together in plastids to yield thiamin monophosphate
  (ThMP) (Goyer, 2010; Rapala-Kozik, 2011). The next steps are (in unknown order)
  export from the plastid and hydrolysis to thiamin (Goyer, 2010). Thiamin then is
  converted to ThDP in the cytosol. A remarkable feature of the pathway is that the
  thiazole synthesis protein Thi4 uses itself as sulphur donor for thiazole formation
  and undergoes only a single turnover (Chatterjee et al., 2011). This makes thiazole
  energetically very costly to produce, and puts a high premium on salvaging thiazole
  moieties from ThDP breakdown.  Biosynthesis and metabolism of thiamin and it's various
  derivatives (mono-, di- , tri- phosphates) and degradation products in plants (or
  other organisms) are far from being elucidated. This diagram is an attempt to capture
  the current state of the field
