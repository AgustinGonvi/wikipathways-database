  "description": "The Fas family of cell surface receptors initiate the apototic pathway through interaction with the external ligand, FasL.  The cytoplasmic domain of Fas interacts with a number of molecules in the transduction of the external signal to the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane. The most notable cytoplasmic domain is the Death Domain (DD) that is involved in recruiting the FAS-associating death domain-containing protein (FADD). This interaction drives downstream events.
