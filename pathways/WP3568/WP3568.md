description: The Fas family of cell surface receptors initiate the apototic pathway
  through interaction with the external ligand, FasL.  The cytoplasmic domain of Fas
  interacts with a number of molecules in the transduction of the external signal
  to the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane. The most notable cytoplasmic domain
  is the Death Domain (DD) that is involved in recruiting the FAS-associating death
  domain-containing protein (FADD). This interaction drives downstream events.  View
