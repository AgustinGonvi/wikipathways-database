description: 'Globins are heme-containing proteins that reversibly bind molecular
  oxygen.  Humans contain at least 5 types of globins: hemoglobins, myoglobin, cytoglobin,
  neuroglobin, and androglobin (reviewed in Burmester et al. 2014). Myoglobin, neuroglobin,
  and cytoglobin are cytosolic globins with similar affinities for oxygen (reviewed
  in Hankeln et al. 2005). Androglobin is a more distantly related globin of uncertain
  function that is expressed in testes (Hoogewijs et al. 2012). Myoglobin is predominantly
  expressed in muscle tissue (reviewed in Helbo et al. 2013), neuroglobin is expressed
  in neurons, and cytoglobin is expressed in connective tissue fibroblasts and smooth
  muscle cells (reviewed in Pesce et al. 2002, Hankeln et al. 2004, Ascenzi et al.
  2016). Whereas myoglobin contains pentacoordinated heme iron, neuroglobin and cytoglobin
  contain hexacoordinated heme iron: the iron atom is bound by 4 nitrogen atoms of
  heme and 2 histidine residues of the globin. Binding by one of the histidines is
  reversible, which allows the iron atom to bind various ligands such as molecular
  oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide (reviewed in Kakar et al. 2010). Neuroglobin
  may function in oxygen homeostasis, however the importance of its oxygen-binding
  activity is unclear (reviewed in Pesce et al. 2002, Hankeln et al. 2005). Cytoglobin
  may function in nitric oxide metabolism (Thuy et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2017). Globins
  can also regulate oxygen homeostasis via reactions with nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator.
  Oxygenated globins scavenge NO by oxidation while deoxygenated globins can act as
  a nitrite reductase to produce NO (reviewed in Hendgen-Cotta et al. 2014, Tejero
  and Gladwin 2014).   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8981607
