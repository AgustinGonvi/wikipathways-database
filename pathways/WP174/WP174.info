description: Chitosan, a beta-1,4 -D-glucosamine homopolymer, is a component of the yeast spore wall (ascospore)  and is produced by the deacetylation of nascent chains of chitin, a beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D- glucosamine  homopolymer.  The CDA1 and CDA2 genes, expressed specifically during sporulation, account for the  total chitin deacetylase activity in S. cerevisiae ((CITS:[8940152])).
