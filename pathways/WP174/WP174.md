description: 'Chitosan, a beta-1,4 -D-glucosamine homopolymer, is a component of the
  yeast spore wall (ascospore)  and is produced by the deacetylation of nascent chains
  of chitin, a beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D- glucosamine  homopolymer.  The CDA1 and CDA2 genes,
  expressed specifically during sporulation, account for the  total chitin deacetylase
  activity in S. cerevisiae ((CITS:[8940152])).  SOURCE: SGD pathways, http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html'
