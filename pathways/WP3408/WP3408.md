description: Evolocumab (Repatha) is an injectable monoclonal antibody that effectively
  reduces LDL-Cholesterol levels. A limited quantity of LDL-Cholesterol is extracted
  from circulative blood when PCSK9-bound LDLR is degraded upon internalization in
  Liver cells. Evolocumab competitively bind PCSK9 away from LDLR complexes, which
  allows LDLR to be recycled, returning to the surface and clearing additional molecules
  of LDL-Cholesterol.
