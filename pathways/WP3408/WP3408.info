Description: Evolocumab (Repatha) is an injectable monoclonal antibody that effectively reduces LDL-Cholesterol levels. A limited quantity of LDL-Cholesterol is extracted from circulative blood when PCSK9-bound LDLR is degraded upon internalization in Liver cells. Evolocumab competitively bind PCSK9 away from LDLR complexes, which allows LDLR to be recycled, returning to the surface and clearing additional molecules of LDL-Cholesterol.
