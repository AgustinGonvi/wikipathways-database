description: This pathway is a concise and simplified version of the basic proteins
  involved in angiogenesis. The proces is regulated by hyopoxia, which results in
  the transcription of eg. VEGF1, FGF2, PDGFbeta, MMP9, MMP2 and Ang1. These proteins
  bind to their receptors and by doing this they initiate different pathways that
  result in vessel formation.
