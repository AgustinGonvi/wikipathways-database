description: Recruitment of receptors and ion channels to the postsynaptic membrane
  is the last step in synapse formation. Many of these proteins interact directly
  or indirectly with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1
  (PDZ) proteins, thus linking them to the postsynaptic scaffold and providing a mechanism
  for both retaining the protein at the synapse and keeping its proximity to signaling
  molecules known to associate with PDZ proteins (Wang et al. 2006, Morimura et al.
  2006, Ko et al. 2006, Nourry et al. 2003, Kim & Sheng 2004, Montgomery et al. 2004,
  Sheng and Kim 2011). The synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALM) family belongs
  to the superfamily of leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing adhesion molecules, alternatively
  referred to as LRFN (leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin III domain-containing)
  is synapse adhesion molecule linked to NMDA and AMPA receptors. It includes five
  known members (SALMs 1-5 or LRFN1-5), which have been implicated in the regulation
  of neurite outgrowth and branching, and synapse formation and maturation. SALM proteins
  are distributed to both dendrites and axons in neurons (Ko et al. 2006, Wang et
  al. 2006, Sebold et al. 2012). The family members, SALM1-SALM5, have a single transmembrane
  (TM) domain and contain extracellular leucine-rich repeats, an Ig C2 type domain,
  a fibronectin type III domain, and an intracellular postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95)/Discs
  large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) binding domain, which is present on all members except
  SALM4 and SALM5 (Ko et al. 2006, Wang et al.2006, Morimura et al. 2006).  View original
