description: Expression of rRNA genes is coupled to the overall metabolism of the
  cell by the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1, a component of the Energy-dependent
  Nucleolar Silencing Complex (eNoSC) (Murayama et al. 2008, reviewed in Salminen
  and Kaarniranta 2009, Grummt and Voit 2010). eNoSC comprises Nucleomethylin (NML),
  SIRT1, and the histone methylase SUV39H1 (Murayama et al. 2008). Deacetylation and
  methylation of histone H3 in the chromatin of a rRNA gene by eNoSC causes reduced
  expression of the gene.  When glucose is low, NAD is high (NADH is low), activity
  of SIRT1 is high, and activity of rRNA genes is reduced. It is hypothesized that
  eNoSC forms on a nucleosome containing dimethylated lysine-9 on histone H3 (H3K9me2)
  and then eNoSC deacetylates and dimethylates the adjacent nucleosome, thus catalyzing
  spreading of H3K9me2 throughout the gene.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=427359
