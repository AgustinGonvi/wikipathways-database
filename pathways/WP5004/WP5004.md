description: In humans, most catabolism of L-lysine normally proceeds via a sequence
  of seven reactions which feeds into the pathway for fatty acid catabolism. In the
  first two reactions, catalyzed by a single enzyme complex, lysine is combined with
  alpha-ketoglutarate to form saccharopine, which in turn is cleaved and oxidized
  to yield glutamate and alpha-ketoadipic semialdehyde. The latter molecule is further
  oxidized to alpha-ketoadipate. Alpha-ketoadipate is oxidatively decarboxylated by
  the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (the same enzyme complex responsible
  for the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA in the citric acid cycle),
  yielding glutaryl-CoA. Glutaryl-CoA is converted to crotonyl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA is
  converted to beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is converted to
  acetoacetyl-CoA. The products of lysine catabolism are thus exclusively ketogenic;
  i.e., under starvation conditions they can be used for the synthesis of ketone bodies,
  beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, but not for the net synthesis of glucose
  (Cox 2001; Goodman and Freeman 2001).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=71064
