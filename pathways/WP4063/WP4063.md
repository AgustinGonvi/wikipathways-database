description: Interleukin-10 (IL10) was originally described as a factor named cytokine
  synthesis inhibitory factor that  inhibited T-helper (Th) 1 activation and Th1 cytokine
  production (Fiorentino et al. 1989). It was found to be expressed by a variety of
  cell types including macrophages, dendritic cell subsets, B cells, several T-cell
  subpopulations including Th2 and T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and Natural Killer (NK)
  cells (Moore et al. 2001). It is now recognized that the biological effects of IL10
  are directed at antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic
  cells (DCs), its effects on T-cell development and differentiation are largely indirect
  via inhibition of macrophage/dendritic cell activation and maturation (Pestka et
  al. 2004, Mocellin et al. 2004). T cells are thought to be the main source of IL10
  (Hedrich & Bream 2010). IL10 inhibits a broad spectrum of activated macrophage/monocyte
  functions including monokine synthesis, NO production, and expression of class II
  MHC and costimulatory molecules such as IL12 and CD80/CD86 (de Waal Malefyt et al.
  1991, Gazzinelli et al. 1992). Studies with recombinant cytokine and neutralizing
  antibodies revealed pleiotropic activities of IL10 on B, T, and mast cells (de Waal
  Malefyt et al. 1993, Rousset et al. 1992, Thompson-Snipes et al. 1991) and provided
  evidence for the in vivo significance of IL10 activities (Ishida et al. 1992, 1993).
  IL10 antagonizes the expression of MHC class II and the co-stimulatory molecules
  CD80/CD86 as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1Beta, IL6, IL8, TNFalpha
  and especially IL12 (Fiorentino et al. 1991, D'Andrea et al. 1993). The biological
  role of IL10 is not limited to inactivation of APCs, it also enhances B cell, granulocyte,
  mast cell, and keratinocyte growth/differentiation, as well as NK-cell and CD8+
  cytotoxic T-cell activation (Moore et al. 2001, Hedrich & Bream 2010). IL10 also
  enhances NK-cell proliferation and/or production of IFN-gamma (Cai et al. 1999).  <br><br>IL10-deficient
  mice exhibited inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other exaggerated inflammatory
  responses (Kuhn et al. 1993, Berg et al. 1995) indicating a critical role for IL10
  in limiting inflammatory responses. Dysregulation of IL10 is linked with susceptibility
  to numerous infectious and autoimmune diseases in humans and mouse models (Hedrich
  & Bream 2010). <br><br>IL10 signaling is initiated by binding of homodimeric IL10
  to the extracellular domains of two adjoining IL10RA molecules. This tetramer then
  binds two IL10RB chains. IL10RB cannot bind to IL10 unless bound to IL10RA (Ding
  et al. 2001, Yoon et al. 2006); binding of IL10 to IL10RA without the co-presence
  of IL10RB fails to initiate signal transduction (Kotenko et al. 1997).<br><br>IL10
  binding activates the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and TYK2,
  which are constitutively bound to IL10R1 and IL10R2 respectively. In the classic
  model of receptor activation assembly of the receptor complex is believed to enable
  JAK1/TYK2 to phosphorylate and activate each other. Alternatively the binding of
  IL10 may cause conformational changes that allow the pseudokinase inhibitory domain
  of one JAK kinase to move away from the kinase domain of the other JAK within the
  receptor dimer-JAK complex, allowing the two kinase domains to interact and trans-activate
  (Waters & Brooks 2015).<br><br>The activated JAK kinases phosphorylate the intracellular
  domains of the IL10R1 chains on specific tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated
  tyrosine residues and their flanking peptide sequences serve as temporary docking
  sites for the latent, cytosolic, transcription factor, STAT3. STAT3 transiently
  docks on the IL10R1 chain via its SH2 domain, and is in turn tyrosine phosphorylated
  by the receptor-associated JAKs. Once activated, it dissociates from the receptor,
  dimerizes with other STAT3 molecules, and translocates to the nucleus where it binds
  with high affinity to STAT-binding elements (SBEs) in the promoters of IL-10-inducible
  genes (Donnelly et al. 1999).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6783783
