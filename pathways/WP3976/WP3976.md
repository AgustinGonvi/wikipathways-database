description: Melanogenesis is the process by which melanocytes produce melanin, a
  pigment found in the skin, eyes, and hair. Melanogenesis leads to a long-lasting
  pigmentation, which is in contrast to the pigmentation that originates from oxidation
  of already-existing melanin. Cutaneous melanin pigment plays a critical role in
  camouflage, mimicry, social communication, and protection against harmful effects
  of solar radiation. Melanogenesis is under complex regulatory control by multiple
  agents. Description adapted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte Wikipedia]
  and [http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map=hsa04916 KEGG].
