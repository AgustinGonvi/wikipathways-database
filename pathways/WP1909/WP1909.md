description: Signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA, SHPS1, CD172a) is a transmembrane
  protein expressed mostly on myeloid cells. CD47, a widely expressed transmembrane
  protein, is a ligand for SIRP alpha, with the two proteins constituting a cell-cell
  communication system. The interaction of SIRPA with CD47 is important for the regulation
  of migration and phagocytosis. SIRPA functions as a docking protein to recruit and
  activate PTPN6 (SHP-1) or PTPN11 (SHP-2) at the cell membrane in response to extracellular
  stimuli. SIRPA also binds other intracellular proteins including the adaptor molecules
  Src kinase-associated protein (SKAP2 SKAP55hom/R), Fyn-binding protein/SLP-76-associated
  phosphoprotein (FYB/SLAP-130) and the tyrosine kinase PYK2. SIRPA also binds the
  extracellular proteins, surfactant-A (SP-A) and surfactant-D (SP-D). <br>The SIRP
  family members SIRPB and SIRPG show high sequence similarity and similar extracellular
  structural topology, including three Ig domains, but their ligand binding topology
  might differ. SIRPB is expressed on myeloid cells, including monocytes, granulocytes
  and DCs. It has no known natural ligand. SIRPG can bind CD47 but with lower affinity
  than SIRPA.   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=391160
