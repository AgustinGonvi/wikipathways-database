description: Complete fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway for saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, developed and curated internally by BiGCaT Bioinformatics.   This pathway was previously split into three parts plus a meta file for statistics. If you still have these you can replace all four with this single pathway.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP143 CPTAC Assay Portal]
