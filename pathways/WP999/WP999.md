description: 'The [[wikipedia:citric_acid_cycle|citric acid cycle]], also known as
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) or the Krebs cycle, (or rarely, the Szent-Gyorgyi-Krebs
  cycle) is a series of enzyme-catalysed chemical reactions of central importance
  in all living cells that use oxygen as part of cellular respiration. In eukaryotes,
  the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion. The components
  and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established by seminal work from both
  [[wikipedia:Albert_Szent-Gyorgyi|Albert Szent-Gyorgyi]] and [[wikipedia:Hans_Krebs|Hans
  Krebs]].  Source: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:citric_acid_cycle]])'
