description: 'Biogenic amines are one of two broad classes of classical neurotransmitters
  (the other being amino acids) and include: acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine,
  and the catecholamines epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Synthesis pathways
  for biogenic amines (in blue) follow solid arrows through enzymatic steps, while
  degradation steps follow the dashed arrows.  Source: http://www.whatislife.com/reader2/Metabolism/pathway/Neurotransmitter.html'
