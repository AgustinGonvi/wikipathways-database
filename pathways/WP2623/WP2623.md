description: 'This pathway represents the reactions for the synthesis and degradation
  in the cytosol of plants. Enzymes, metabolites and cofactors are represented according
  to different sources (KEGG, Plant Physiology (third edition), UniProt) Enzyme IDs
  are either UniProt or Enzyme code and are non-exhaustive due to the redundancy of
  most databases. This pathway is partly based on: http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ath00500
  Links to other pathways are represented as well.'
