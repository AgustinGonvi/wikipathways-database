Description: This pathway represents the reactions for the synthesis and degradation in the cytosol of plants. Enzymes, metabolites and cofactors are represented according to different sources (KEGG, Plant Physiology (third edition), UniProt) Enzyme IDs are either UniProt or Enzyme code and are non-exhaustive due to the redundancy of most databases. This pathway is partly based on: http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ath00500 Links to other pathways are represented as well.
