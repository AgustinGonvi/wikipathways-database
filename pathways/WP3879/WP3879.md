description: 'This pathway is modeled after Figure 7 in the article ''''Upstream molecular
  signaling pathways of p27(Kip1) expression: effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, dexamethasone,
  and retinoic acids'''' (See Bibliography). Several anticancer agents up-regulate
  expression of p27, a cyclin-dpendent kinase inhibitor that blocks the transition
  from G1 to S phase. The pathways used by the anticancer agents (retinoic acids,
  4-hydroxytamoxifen, dexamethasone) are shown above from human breast cancer cells.'
