description: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a major Ï‰-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) found in fish oil is the source of E-series resolvins (RvEs), one of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) that show potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions (Molfino et al. 2017). The biosynthesis of RvEs occurs mainly during the process of inflammation when endothelial cells interact with leukocytes. EPA, circulating in plasma or released/mobilised from damaged cellular membranes on injury or infection, moves with edema into the tissue sites of acute inflammation where it is converted to exudate RvEs to interact with local immune cells (Kasuga et al. 2008). The initial transformation of EPA by aspirin-acetylated cyclooxygenase 2- and/or cytochrome P450-mediated catalysis can produce stereospecific resolvins (18(R)- or 18(S)-RvEs). Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions determine the type of resolvin formed (RvE1, RvE2 or RvE3) (Serhan et al. 2000, 2002, Serhan & Petasis 2011, Maehre et al. 2015).
