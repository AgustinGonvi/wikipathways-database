description: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a major Ï‰-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid
  (PUFA) found in fish oil is the source of E-series resolvins (RvEs), one of the
  specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) that show potent anti-inflammatory and
  pro-resolving actions (Molfino et al. 2017). The biosynthesis of RvEs occurs mainly
  during the process of inflammation when endothelial cells interact with leukocytes.
  EPA, circulating in plasma or released/mobilised from damaged cellular membranes
  on injury or infection, moves with edema into the tissue sites of acute inflammation
  where it is converted to exudate RvEs to interact with local immune cells (Kasuga
  et al. 2008). The initial transformation of EPA by aspirin-acetylated cyclooxygenase
  2- and/or cytochrome P450-mediated catalysis can produce stereospecific resolvins
  (18(R)- or 18(S)-RvEs). Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions
  determine the type of resolvin formed (RvE1, RvE2 or RvE3) (Serhan et al. 2000,
  2002, Serhan & Petasis 2011, Maehre et al. 2015).   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9018679
