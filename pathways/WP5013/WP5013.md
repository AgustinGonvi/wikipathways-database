description: 'Tail-anchored (TA) proteins have a hydrophobic transmembrane domain
  (TMD) located near the C-terminus ("tail") of the protein. Depending on the nature
  of the TMD, TA proteins can be inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane
  by at least 4 mechanisms: cotranslational insertion by the signal recognition particle
  (SRP), post-translational insertion by ASNA1 (TRC40), post-translational insertion
  by the SRP, and post-translational insertion by a SRP-independent mechanism (SND)
  (Casson et al. 2017, reviewed in Borgese and Fasana 2011, Casson et al. 2016, Aviram
  et al. 2016, Chio et al. 2017). Much of the information about the mammalian system
  of insertion by ASNA1 (TRC40) has been inferred from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  homologue Get3.<br> Prior to post-translational insertion by ASNA1, SGTA binds the
  transmembrane domain of the substrate TA protein immediately after translation (Leznicki
  et al. 2011, Leznicki and High 2012, Xu et al. 2012, Wunderly et al. 2014, Shao
  et al. 2017), the SGTA:TA protein complex then binds the BAG6 complex (BAG6:GET4:UBL4A)
  via UBL4A (Winnefeld et al. 2006, Chartron et al. 2012, Xu et al. 2012, Leznicki
  et al. 2013, Mock et al. 2015, Kuwabara et al. 2015, Shao et al. 2017), and the
  TA protein is transferred to ASNA1 (Mariappan et al. 2010, Leznicki et al. 2011,
  Shao et al. 2017), also bound by the BAG6 complex via UBL4A. The ASNA1:TA protein
  complex then docks at the WRB:CAMLG (WRB:CAML) complex located in the ER membrane
  and the TA protein is inserted into the ER membrane by an uncharacterized mechanism
  that involves ATP and the transmembrane domain insertase activity of the WRB:CAML
  complex (Vilardi et al. 2011, Vilardi et al. 2014, Vogl et al. 2016, and inferred
  from yeast in Wang et al. 2014).<br>Misfolded TA proteins, overexpressed TA proteins,
  and membrane proteins mislocalized in the cytosol bind SGTA but are not efficiently
  transferred to ASNA1 and, instead, are retained by BAG6 which recruits RNF126 to
  ubiquitinate them, targeting them for degradation by the proteasome (Wang et al.
  2011, Leznicki and High 2012, Xu et al. 2012, Rodrigo-Brenni et al. 2014, Wunderly
  et al. 2014, Shao et al. 2017, reviewed in Lee and Ye 2013, Casson et al. 2016,
