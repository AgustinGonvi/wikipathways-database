Description: In plants, polyamines are oxidatively deaminated by copper- and flavin-containing odixases (CuAO and PAO) leading to the generation of H2O2 and 4-aminobutanal (ABAL) which can be converted to 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA). A well known neurotransmitter in animals, GABA plays a role in stress response in plants.
