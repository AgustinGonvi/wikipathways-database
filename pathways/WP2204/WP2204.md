description: Maize is one of the essential staple cereal crop plant that has the ability
  to naturally accumulate nutritionally important carotenoids in the edible seed endosperm.
  The carotenoid pigments are generally C40 isoprenoids that are hydrophobic and synthesized
  in the plastids. Amyloplast is the kind of plastid found in seed endosperm. The
  final product all-trans-lycopene synthesized in the final step in this pathway is
  the founder precursor for carotenoid biosynthesis in plants.
