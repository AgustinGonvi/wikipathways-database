description: The fatty acid synthesis of the roundworm C. Elegans is a highly conserved
  pathway evolutionary. This pathways is therefore of great importance to understand
  fat synthesis and nutrient sensing in adiposity regulation, which is key to understand
  the molecular mechanism behind obesity.
