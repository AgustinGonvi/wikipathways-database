Description: Interleukin-3 belongs to a family of cytokines, which includes IL-5 and GM-CSF. It signals through a receptor complex comprising of an IL-3 specific IL-3 receptor alpha subunit (IL3RA) and a common beta chain, which is shared between all members of this cytokine family. Binding of IL-3 to IL3RA recruits the beta chain to the complex, which activates the JAK/STAT, MAPK and PI 3-kinase signaling modules.
