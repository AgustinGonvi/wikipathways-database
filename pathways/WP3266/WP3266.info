Description: The most frequently altered genes in glioblastoma. This pathway originally accompanied the 2008 Nature publication on the comprehensive genomic characterization of human glioblastoma genes and core pathways by TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas (see Bibliography).  Assembled from  literature and public pathway database resources, this representation can easily be kept up-to-date at WikiPathways.org.
