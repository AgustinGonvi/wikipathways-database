description: 'The crosslinked fibrin multimers in a clot are broken down to soluble
  polypeptides by plasmin, a serine protease. Plasmin can be generated from its inactive
  precursor plasminogen and recruited to the site of a fibrin clot in two ways, by
  interaction with tissue plasminogen activator at the surface of a fibrin clot, and
  by interaction with urokinase plasminogen activator at a cell surface. The first
  mechanism appears to be the major one responsible for the dissolution of clots within
  blood vessels. The second, although capable of mediating clot dissolution, may normally
  play a major role in tissue remodeling, cell migration, and inflammation (Chapman
  1997; Lijnen 2001).<br>Clot dissolution is regulated in two ways. First, efficient
  plasmin activation and fibrinolysis occur only in complexes formed at the clot surface
  or on a cell membrane - proteins free in the blood are inefficient catalysts and
  are rapidly inactivated. Second, both plasminogen activators and plasmin itself
  are inactivated by specific serpins, proteins that bind to serine proteases to form
  stable, enzymatically inactive complexes (Kohler and Grant 2000).<br>These events
  are outlined in the drawing: black arrows connect the substrates (inputs) and products
  (outputs) of individual reactions, and blue lines connect output activated enzymes
  to the other reactions that they catalyze.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=75205
