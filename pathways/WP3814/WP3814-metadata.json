  "description": "Metallothioneins are highly conserved, cysteine-rich proteins that bind metals via thiolate bonds (recent general reviews in Capdevila et al. 2012, Blindauer et al. 2014, reviews of mammalian metallothioneins in Miles et al. 2000, Maret 2011, Vasak and Meloni 2011, Thirumoorthy et al. 2001, Babula et al. 2012). Mammals contain 4 general metallothionein isoforms (MT1,2,3,4). The MT1 isoform has radiated in primates to 8 or 9 functional proteins (depending on classification of MT1L). Each mammalian metallothionein binds a total of 7 divalent metal ions in two clusters, the alpha and beta clusters. Though the functions of metallothioneins have not been fully elucidated, they appear to participate in detoxifying heavy metals (reviewed in Sharma et al. 2013), storing and transporting zinc, and redox biochemistry. Metallothioneins interact with many other cellular proteins, with most interactions involving proteins of the central nervous system (reviewed in Atrian and Capdevila 2013).
