description: This pathway describes TCA cycle (Krebs Cycle) reactions in A. thaliana
  mitochondria.The metabolic links with the Glycolysis and Glutamate Biosynthesis
  are indicated. Protein identifiers for A. thaliana are from UNIPROT. The pathway
  is inspired from information drawn for Plant Physiology (Taiz and Zeiger) Third
  Edition and KEGG Pathways.
