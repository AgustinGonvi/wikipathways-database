description: Schematic representation of inhibition of exosome biogenesis and secretion
  by Manumycin A (MA) in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells (CRPC) cells.
  The inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway by MA leads to transcriptional down-regulation
  of hnRNP H1. A decrease in hnRNP H1 transcripts leads to inhibition of exosome biogenesis
  and secretion by suppressing ALIX and Rab27a.  Description from Datta et al.
