Description: Schematic representation of inhibition of exosome biogenesis and secretion by Manumycin A (MA) in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells (CRPC) cells. The inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway by MA leads to transcriptional down-regulation of hnRNP H1. A decrease in hnRNP H1 transcripts leads to inhibition of exosome biogenesis and secretion by suppressing ALIX and Rab27a.  Description from Datta et al.
