description: Vitamin A (retinol) can be metabolised into active retinoid metabolites
  that function either as a chromophore in vision or in regulating gene expression
  transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Genes regulated by retinoids are essential
  for reproduction, embryonic development, growth, and multiple processes in the adult,
  including energy balance, neurogenesis, and the immune response. The retinoid used
  as a cofactor in the visual cycle  is 11-cis-retinal (11cRAL). The non-visual cycle
  effects of retinol are mediated by retinoic acid (RA), generated by two-step conversion
  from retinol (Napoli 2012).  All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is the major activated
  metabolite of retinol. An isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) has biological activity,
  but has not been detected in vivo, except in the pancreas. An alternative route
  involves BCO1 cleavage of carotenoids into retinal, which is then reduced into retinol
  in the intestine (Harrison 2012). The two isomers of RA serve as ligands for  retinoic
  acid receptors (RAR) that regulate gene expression. (Das et al. 2014). RA is catabolised
  to oxidised metabolites such as 4-hydroxy-, 18-hydroxy-  or 4-oxo-RA by CYP family
  enzymes, these metabolites then becoming substrates for Phase II conjugation enzymes
  (Ross & Zolfaghari 2011).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5362517
