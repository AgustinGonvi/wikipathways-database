Description: This pathway is an adaptation from figure 2.a in Stefani et al. (2008). miR-1 regulates cardiac morphogenesis by optimizing the level of the HAND2 transcription factor. Electric conduction is abnormal in mice that lack miR-1 as a consequence of de-inhibition of IRX5, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that represses the expression of the KCND2 potassium channel.
