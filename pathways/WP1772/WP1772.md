description: Apoptosis, or cell death program, can be activated by various mechanisms
  within the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathway. While activation of cell death receptors
  leads to the engagement of the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway is activated
  by mitochondria during cellular stress, both  resulting in an activation of caspases.  In
  the present pathway we emphasized the activation of caspases by those two pathways
  in pancreatic cancer (PDAC) cells. Please notice, that PDAC cells are so called
  type-II cells. In these cells the activation of cell death receptors is not sufficient
  to activated caspases. By cleavage of Bid, type-II cells activate the intrinsic
  pathway as "amplification loop".   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays
  available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1772 CPTAC
  Assay Portal]
