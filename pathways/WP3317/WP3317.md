description: In the presence of Netrin1, DCC and UNC5 generate attractive and repulsive
  signals to growing axons. In the absence of Netrin-1, DCC induces cell death signaling
  initiated via caspase cleavage of DCC and the interaction of caspase-9. Recent reports
  have shown that UNC5 receptors similarly induce apoptosis in the absence of Netrin-1.
  These reactions proceed without a requirement for cytochrome c release from mitochondria
  or interaction with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1). DCC thus regulates
  an apoptosome-independent pathway for caspase activation. DCC and UNC-5 are hence
  defined as dependence receptors. Dependence receptors exhibit dual functions depending
  on the availability of ligand. They create cellular states of dependence on their
  respective ligands by either inducing apoptosis when unoccupied by the ligand, or
  inhibiting apoptosis in the presence of the ligand.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=418889
