description: The movement of the animal in relation to its environment requires coordinating
  an awareness of environmental cues with the firing of neuronal circuitry affecting
  the simultaneous  contraction and relaxation of opposing muscle groups. C. elegans
  exhibits many types of movement, the two major types are crawling and swimming.
  Each of these movements have been further characterized by dominant body shapes,
  trajectories, angles, speeds, etc., peculiar to the movement. Fundamental to survival
  of the worm is the ability to sense and move towards or away from different stimuli.
  Forward and backwards movements can be induced in the lab through the stimulation
  of the mechanosensory neural network.
