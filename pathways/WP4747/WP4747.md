description: UNC-5 Homolog B (UNC5B) is a member of the dependence receptor family.
  It can induce two opposite intracellular signaling cascades depending on the presence
  or absence of the ligand and is thus capable of driving two opposing processes.
  UNC5B signaling has been implicated in several cancers, where it promotes cell death
  in the absence of its ligand netrin-1 and increases cell survival in its presence.
  In addition, inhibition of the ligand has been reported to decrease invasiveness
  and angiogenesis in tumors. UNC5B signaling pathway has also been reported to be
  involved in several processes such as neural development, developmental angiogenesis
  and inflammatory processes. Interaction of UNC5B with netrins activates various
  signaling modules including ERK1/ERK2, p38 MAPK signaling and PI3k-AKT pathway modules
