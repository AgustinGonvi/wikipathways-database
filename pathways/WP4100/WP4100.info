description: Experiments using human cord blood CD4(+) T cells show 22 protein spots and 20 protein spots, upregulated and downregulated proteins respectively, following Interleukin-12 stimulation (Rosengren et.al, 2005).  The identified upregulated proteins are:  BOLA2, PSME2,  MTAP, CA1,  GSTA2,  RALA,  CNN2,  CFL1,  TCP1,  HNRNPDL,  MIF,  AIP,  SOD1, PPIA and  PDCD4.<br>And the identified downregulated proteins are:<br>ANXA2, RPLP0, CAPZA1, SOD2, SNRPA1, LMNB1, LCP1, HSPA9, SERPINB2, HNRNPF, TALDO1, PAK2, TCP1, HNRNPA2B1, MSN, PITPNA, ARF1, SOD2, ANXA2, CDC42, RAP1B and GSTO1.
