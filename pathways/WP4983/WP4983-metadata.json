  "description": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) constitutes a family of universal transcription factors. STAT5 refers to two highly related proteins, STAT5A and STAT5B, with critical function in cell survival and proliferation. Several upstream signals including cytokines and growth factors can trigger STAT5 activation.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9645135 Reactome].",
