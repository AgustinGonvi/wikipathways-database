description: FOXO transcription factors promote expression of several pro-apoptotic genes, such as FASLG (Brunet et al. 1999, Ciechomska et al. 2003, Chen et al. 2013, Li et al. 2015), PINK1 (Mei et al. 2009, Sengupta et al. 2011), BCL2L11 (BIM) (Gilley et al. 2003, Urbich et al. 2005, Chuang et al. 2007, Hughes et al. 2011, Chen et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2016), BCL6 (Tang et al. 2002, Fernandez de Mattos et al. 2004, Shore et al. 2006) and BBC3 (PUMA) (Dudgeon et al. 2010, Hughes et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2015, Wu et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2017, Fitzwalter et al. 2018). FOXO-mediated induction of cell death genes is important during development, for example during nervous system development, where FOXO promotes neuronal death upon NGF withdrawal (Gilley et al. 2003), and also contributes to the tumor-suppressive role of FOXO factors (Arimoto Ishida et al. 2004). FOXO1 transcriptional activity is implicated in the cell death of enteric nervous system (ENS) precursors. RET signaling, which activates PI3K/AKT signaling, leading to inhibition of FOXO mediated transcription, ensures survival of ENS precursors (Srinivasan et al. 2005).<br>Transcription of the STK11 (LKB1) gene, encoding Serine/threonine-protein kinase STK11 (also known as Liver kinase B1), which regulates diverse cellular processes, including apoptosis, is directly stimulated by FOXO3 and FOXO4 (Lutzner et al. 2012).
