description: The interleukin 20 (IL20) subfamily comprises IL19, IL20, IL22, IL24 and IL26. They are members of the larger IL10 family, but have been grouped together based on their usage of common receptor subunits and similarities in their target cell profiles and biological functions. Members of the IL20 subfamily facilitate the communication between leukocytes and epithelial cells, thereby enhancing innate defence mechanisms and tissue repair processes at epithelial surfaces. Much of the understanding of this group of cytokines is based on IL22, which is the most studied member (Rutz et al. 2014, Akdis M et al. 2016, Longsdon et al. 2012).
