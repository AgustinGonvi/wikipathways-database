description: Many proteins depend for their activity on cofactors, associated ions and small molecules. This module contains annotations of processes involved in the synthesis of cofactors, either de novo or from essential molecules consumed in the diet (vitamins), as well as regeneration of active forms of cofactors (Lipmann 1984).
