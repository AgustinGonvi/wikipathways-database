description: RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the silencing of gene expression by
  the overexpression of sequence-specific RNA molecules. This process is associated
  with a cellular and nuclear defense mechanism used to combat molecular parasites
  such as transposons and viruses. In addition, RNA interference has been shown to
  play a regulatory role in development. Work in C. elegans and other organisms have
  identified many key regulators and pathways necessary for this process. RNAi has
  been adapted into a tool for the study of gene function; through the use of RNAi,
  the expression of a target gene can be inhibited by the reverse engineering of a
  corresponding dsRNA.
