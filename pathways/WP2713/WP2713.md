description: Stem cell factor (SCF) is a growth factor with membrane bound and soluble
  forms. It is expressed by fibroblasts and endothelial cells throughout the body,
  promoting proliferation, migration, survival and differentiation of hematopoetic
  progenitors, melanocytes and germ cells.(Linnekin 1999, Ronnstrand 2004, Lennartsson
  and Ronnstrand 2006). The receptor for SCF is KIT, a tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK)
  closely related to the receptors for platelet derived growth factor receptor, colony
  stimulating factor 1 (Linnekin 1999) and Flt3 (Rosnet et al. 1991).  Four isoforms
  of c-Kit have been identified in humans. Alternative splicing results in isoforms
  of KIT differing in the presence or absence of four residues (GNNK) in the extracellular
  region. This occurs due to the use of an alternate 5' splice donor site. These GNNK+
  and GNNK- variants are co-expressed in most tissues; the GNNK- form predominates
  and was more strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated and more rapidly internalized (Ronnstrand
  2004). There are also splice variants that arise from alternative usage of splice
  acceptor site resulting in the presence or absence of a serine residue (Crosier
  et al., 1993). Finally, there is an alternative shorter transcript of KIT expressed
  in postmeiotic germ cells in the testis  which encodes a truncated KIT consisting
  only of the second part of the kinase domain and thus lackig the extracellular and
  transmembrane domains as well as the first part of the kinase domain (Rossi et al.
  1991). Binding  of SCF homodimers to KIT results in KIT homodimerization followed
  by activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. KIT stimulation activates
  a wide array of signalling pathways including MAPK, PI3K and JAK/STAT (Reber et
  al. 2006, Ronnstrand 2004). Defects of KIT in humans are associated with different
  genetic diseases and also in several types of cancers like mast cell leukaemia,
  germ cell tumours, certain subtypes of malignant melanoma and gastrointestinal tumours.  View
