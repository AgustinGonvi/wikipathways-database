description: Binding of IGF1 (IGF-I) or IGF2 (IGF-II) to the extracellular alpha peptides of the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) triggers the activation of two major signaling pathways: the SOS-RAS-RAF-MAPK (ERK) pathway and the PI3K-PKB (AKT) pathway (recently reviewed in Pavelic et al. 2007, Chitnis et al. 2008, Maki et al. 2010, Parella et al. 2010, Annunziata et al. 2011, Siddle et al. 2012, Holzenberger 2012).
