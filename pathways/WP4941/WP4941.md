description: A disease model demonstrating the potential place of the GPR143 gene
  in the pathogenesis of ocular albinism type 1. The latter shows the interactions
  between GPR143 and the different genes responsible for melanogenesis as well as
  growth factors such as SERPINF1 and VEGF in melanocytes or the retinal pigment epithelium.
