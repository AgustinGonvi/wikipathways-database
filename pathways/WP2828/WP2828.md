description: The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary
  tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal
  urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial
  carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the
  total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways.
  Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial
  papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma
  in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive
  tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of
  the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the
  HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and
  invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways.
  Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment,
  including the aberrant expression of  E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2828
