description: Microautophagy (MI) is a non-selective autophagic pathway that involves internalisation of cytosolic cargo through invaginations of the lysosomal membrane. MI can be induced by nitrogen starvation and complements other related self-eating processes such as Macroautophagy (MA) and Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA). MI can degrade cell organelles and bulk cytosolic proteins directly via the lysosome and late endosome. MI can also target substrates with KFERQ motifs with the help of HSPA8 (Li W W et al. 2012).
