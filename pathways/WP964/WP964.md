description: (From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle) The cell cycle is the
  series of events that takes place in a cell leading to its division and duplication
  (replication). Regulation of the cell cycle involves processes crucial to the survival
  of a cell, including the detection and repair of genetic damage as well as the prevention
  of uncontrolled cell division. Two key classes of regulatory molecules, cyclins
  and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), determine a cell's progress through the cell
  cycle.
