description: Studies indicate there is a connection between ceramides and insulin
  resistance. Ceramides are accumulated in tissues due to an excessive supply of saturated
  fatty acids. In obese subjects, the amount of ceramides found in skeletal muscles
  is nearly double of healthy subjects.   Ceramides are produced mostly as a result
  of the sphingolipid pathway. Besides the sphingolipid pathway, ceramides are also
  produced by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin with the catalysis of nSMase2.   In
  the cell, ceramides play a role in insulin resistance. to Ceramides inhibits the
  binding of PDX-1 and MAFA transcriptional factors to insulin promoter. Ceramides
  cause ER stress, which activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK8 and
  EIF2AK2. This leads to the upregulation of serine phosphorylation while downregulating
  tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. which leads to the inhibition of recruitment
  and activation of PI3K. This leads to a downregulation in AKT1, an enzyme that stimulates
  the translocation of GLUT4. Ceramides also impair mitochondria functions and inhibit
  fatty acid oxidation, eventually leading to ROS and inflammation. Ceramides activate
  protein PP2A, which promotes the dephosphorylation of AKT1. PKCζ is also activated
  by ceramides to inhibit the activity of AKT1.   Moreover, Palmitoyl-CoA downregulates
  the phosphorylation of AMPK, which leads to the increase of ER stress in the cell
  and decreases in fatty acid oxidation.   On the other hand, Oleic Acid inhibits
  the downregulation of AMPK caused by Palmitoyl-CoA. Oleic Acid also increases the
  expression of CPT1B, stimulating the fatty acid oxidation to reduce the inflammation
  in the cell.
