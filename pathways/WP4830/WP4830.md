description: GDNF-RET signalling is at the core of the signalling network in kidney
  development. These signalling interactions between the metanephric mesenchyme and
  the nephric duct are crucial to ensure the induction of the ureter from the nephric
  duct.  Pathway converted from original mouse pathway WP4820.
