description: Similar to NOTCH1, NOTCH3 is activated by delta-like and jagged ligands
  (DLL/JAG) expressed in trans on a neighboring cell. The activation triggers cleavage
  of NOTCH3, first by ADAM10 at the S2 cleavage site, then by gamma-secretase at the
  S3 cleavage site, resulting in the release of the intracellular domain of NOTCH3,
  NICD3, into the cytosol. NICD3 subsequently traffics to the nucleus where it acts
  as a transcriptional regulator. NOTCH3 expression pattern is more restricted than
  the expression patterns of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, with predominant expression of NOTCH3
  in vascular smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes and the nervous system (reviewed by
  Bellavia et al. 2008). Based on the study of Notch3 knockout mice, Notch3 is not
  essential for embryonic development or fertility (Krebs et al. 2003).<p><p>Germline
  gain-of-function NOTCH3 mutations are an underlying cause of the CADASIL syndrome
  - cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
  CADASIL is characterized by degeneration and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells
  from the arterial wall, predisposing affected individuals to an early onset stroke
  (Storkebaum et al. 2011). NOTCH3 promotes survival of vascular smooth muscle cells
  at least in part by induction of CFLAR (c FLIP), an inhibitor of FASLG activated
  death receptor signaling. The mechanism of NOTCH3 mediated upregulation of CFLAR
  is unknown; it is independent of the NOTCH3 coactivator complex and involves an
  unelucidated crosstalk with the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway (Wang et al. 2002).<p><p>In
  rat brain, NOTCH3 and NOTCH1 are expressed at sites of adult neurogenesis, such
  as the dentate gyrus (Irvin et al. 2001). NOTCH3, similar to NOTCH1, promotes differentiation
  of the rat adult hippocampus derived multipotent neuronal progenitors into astroglia
  (Tanigaki et al. 2001). NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and their ligand DLL1 are expressed
  in neuroepithelial precursor cells in the neural tube of mouse embryos. Together,
  they signal to inhibit neuronal differentiation of neuroepithelial precursors. Expression
  of NOTCH3 in mouse neuroepithelial precursors is stimulated by growth factors BMP2,
  FGF2, Xenopus TGF beta5 - homologous to TGFB1, LIF, and NTF3 (Faux et al. 2001).<p>In
  mouse telencephalon, NOTCH3, similar to NOTCH1, promotes radial glia and neuronal
  progenitor phenotype. This can, at least in part be attributed to NOTCH mediated
  activation of RBPJ-dependent and HES5-dependent transcription (Dang et al. 2006).<p>In
  mouse spinal cord, Notch3 is involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation.
  Notch3 knockout mice have a decreased number of mature inhibitory interneurons in
  the spinal cord, which may be involved in chronic pain conditions (Rusanescu and
  Mao 2014).<p><p>NOTCH3 amplification was reported in breast cancer, where NOTCH3
  promotes proliferation and survival of ERBB2 negative breast cancer cells (Yamaguchi
  et al. 2008), and it has also been reported in ovarian cancer (Park et al. 2006).
  NOTCH3 signaling is involved in TGF beta (TGFB1) signaling-induced eptihelial to
  mesenchimal transition (EMT) (Ohashi et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2014)<p><p>NOTCH3 indirectly
  promotes development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). NOTCH3 signaling activates pre-TCR-dependent
  and PKC-theta (PRKCQ)-dependent NF-kappaB (NFKB) activation, resulting in induction
  of FOXP3 expression (Barbarulo et al. 2011). Deregulated NOTCH3 and pre-TCR signaling
  contributes to development of leukemia and lymphoma (Bellavia et al. 2000, Bellavia
  et al. 2002).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9012852
