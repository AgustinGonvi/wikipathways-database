description: Photodynamic therapy may induce a proteotoxic stress response mediated
  by transcription factors heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1),
  activating transcription factor (ATF) 6, and ATF4.   Proteins on this pathway have
  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3613
