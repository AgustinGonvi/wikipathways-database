description: Hypothetical pathway linking cranio-facial development pathway (IRF6,
  TP63, TFAP2A, and TGFB3) to Rho signaling pathway through ARHGAP29 regulation. Authors
  of literature suspect that a decrease of ARHGAP29 concentration would result in
  more active form, Rho-GTP, which would down-regulate cranio-facial development genes.
  An implication of this active Rho-GTP may be the formation of cleft lip. This pathway
  is based on figure 4 from Leslie et al.
