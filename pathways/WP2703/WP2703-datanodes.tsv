Syndecan
interactions	Pathway	R-HSA-3000170	Reactome	Syndecans are type I transmembrane proteins, with an N-terminal ectodomain that contains several consensus sequences for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Syndecan-1 and -3 GAG attachment sites occur in two distinct clusters, one near the N-terminus and the other near the membrane-attachment site, separated by a proline and threonine-rich 'spacer'. Syndecan ectodomain sequences are poorly conserved in the family and between species, but the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are highly conserved. Syndecan-1 and -3 form a subfamily. Syndecan core proteins form dimers (Choi et al. 2007) and at least syndecan-3 and -4 form oligomers (Asundi & Carey 1995, Shin et al. 2012).  Syndecan-1 is the major syndecan of epithelial cells including vascular endothelium. Syndecan-2 is present mostly in mesenchymal, neuronal and smooth muscle cells. Syndecan-3 is the major syndecan of the nervous system, while syndecan-4 is ubiquitously expressed but at lower levels than the other syndecans (refs in Alexopoulou et al. 2007). The core syndecan protein has three to five heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate chains, which interact with a variety of ligands including fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, fibronectin, collagen, vitronectin and several integrins. Syndecans may act as integrin coreceptors. Interactions between fibronectin and syndecans are modulated by tenascin-C. 

Syndecans bind a wide variety of soluble and insoluble ligands, inckluding extracellular matrix components, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines, and proteinases. As the cleaved ectodomains of syndecans retain the ability to bind ligands, ectodomain shedding is a mechanism for releasing soluble effectors that may compete for ligands with their cell-bound counterparts (Kainulainen et al. 1998). Shed  ectodomains are found in inflammatory fluids (Subramanian et al. 1997) and may induce the proliferation of cancer cells (Maeda et al. 2004).

Degradation of the
extracellular
matrix	Pathway	R-HSA-1474228	Reactome	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), previously referred to as matrixins because of their role in degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), are zinc and calcium dependent proteases belonging to the metzincin family. They contain a characteristic zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH (Stocker & Bode 1995) and a conserved Methionine which forms a Met-turn. Humans have 24 MMP genes giving rise to 23 MMP proteins, as MMP23 is encoded by two identical genes. All MMPs contain an N-terminal secretory signal peptide and a prodomain with a conserved PRCGXPD motif that in the inactive enzyme is localized with the catalytic site, the cysteine acting as a fourth unpaired ligand for the catalytic zinc atom. Activation involves delocalization of the domain containing this cysteine by a conformational change or proteolytic cleavage, a mechanism referred to as the cysteine-switch (Van Wart & Birkedal-Hansen 1990).  Most MMPs are secreted but the membrane type MT-MMPs are membrane anchored and some MMPs may act on intracellular proteins. Various domains determine substrate specificity, cell localization and activation (Hadler-Olsen et al. 2011). MMPs are regulated by transcription, cellular location (most are not activated until secreted), activating proteinases that can be other MMPs, and by metalloproteinase inhibitors such as the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are best known for their role in the degradation and removal of ECM molecules. In addition, cleavage of the ECM and other cell surface molecules can release ECM-bound growth factors, and a number of non-ECM proteins are substrates of MMPs (Nagase et al. 2006). MMPs can be divided into subgroups based on domain structure and substrate specificity but it is clear that these are somewhat artificial, many MMPs belong to more than one functional group (Vise & Nagase 2003, Somerville et al. 2003).

Elastic fibre
formation	Pathway	R-HSA-1566948	Reactome	Elastic fibres (EF) are a major structural constituent of dynamic connective tissues such as large arteries and lung parenchyma, where they provide essential properties of elastic recoil and resilience. EF are composed of a central cross-linked core of elastin, surrounded by a mesh of microfibrils, which are composed largely of fibrillin. In addition to elastin and fibrillin-1, over 30 ancillary proteins are involved in mediating important roles in elastic fibre assembly as well as interactions with the surrounding environment. These include fibulins, elastin microfibril interface located proteins (EMILINs), microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs) and Latent TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBPs). Fibulin-5 for example, is expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells and plays an essential role in the formation of elastic fibres through mediating interactions between elastin and fibrillin (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Freeman et al. 2005). In addition, it plays a role in cell adhesion through integrin receptors and has been shown to influence smooth muscle cell proliferation (Yanigasawa et al. 2002, Nakamura et al. 2002). EMILINs are a family of homologous glycoproteins originally identified in extracts of aortas. Found at the elastin-fibrillin interface, early studies showed that antibodies to EMILIN can affect the process of elastic fibre formation (Bressan et al. 1993). EMILIN1 has been shown to bind elastin and fibulin-5 and appears to coordinate their common interaction (Zanetti et al. 2004). MAGPs are found to co-localize with microfibrils. MAGP-1, for example, binds strongly to an N-terminal sequence of fibrillin-1. Other proteins found associated with microfibrils include vitronectin (Dahlback et al. 1990).<br><br>Fibrillin is most familiar as a component of elastic fibres but microfibrils with no elastin are found in the ciliary zonules of the eye and invertebrate circulatory systems. The addition of elastin to microfibrils is a vertebrate adaptation to high pulsatile pressures in their closed circulatory systems (Faury et al. 2003). Elastin appears to have emerged after the divergence of jawless vertebrates from other vertebrates (Sage 1982). <br><br>Fibrillin-1 is the major structural component of microfibrils. Fibrillin-2 is expressed earlier in development than fibrillin-1 and may be important for elastic fiber formation (Zhang et al. 1994). Fibrillin-3 arose as a duplication of fibrillin-2 that did not occur in the rodent lineage. It was first isolated from human brain (Corson et al. 2004).<br><br>Fibrillin assembly is not as well defined as elastin assembly. The primary structure of fibrillin is dominated by calcium binding epidermal growth factor like repeats (Kielty et al. 2002). Fibrillin may form dimers or trimers before secretion. However, multimerisation predominantly occurs outside the cell. Formation of fibrils appears to require cell surface structures suggesting an involvement of cell surface receptors. Fibrillin is assembled pericellularly (i.e. on or close to the cell surface) into microfibrillar arrays that undergo time dependent maturation into microfibrils with beaded-string appearance. Transglutaminase forms gamma glutamyl epsilon lysine isopeptide bonds within or between peptide chains. Additionally, intermolecular disulfide bond formation between fibrillins is an important contributor to fibril maturation (Reinhardt et al. 2000).<br><br>Models of fibrillin-1 microfibril structure suggest that the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 is asymmetrically exposed in outer filaments, while the C-terminal half is buried in the interior (Kuo et al. 2007). Fibrillinopathies include Marfan syndrome, familial ectopia lentis, familial thoracic aneurysm, all due to mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene FBN1,  and congenital contractural arachnodactyly which is caused by mutation of FBN2 (Maslen & Glanville 1993, Davis & Summers 2012).<br><br>In vivo assembly of fibrillin requires the presence of extracellular fibronectin fibres (Sabatier et al. 2009). Fibrillins have Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences that interact with integrins (Pfaff et al. 1996, Sakamoto et al. 1996, Bax et al., 2003, Jovanovic et al. 2008) and heparin-binding domains that interact with a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (Tiedemann et al. 2001) possibly a syndecan (Ritty et al. 2003). Fibrillins also have a major role in binding and sequestering growth factors such as TGF beta into the ECM  (Neptune et al. 2003). Proteoglycans such as versican (Isogai et al. 2002), biglycan, and decorin (Reinboth et al. 2002) can interact with the microfibrils. They confer specific properties including hydration, impact absorption, molecular sieving, regulation of cellular activities, mediation of growth factor association, and release and transport within the extracellular matrix (Buczek-Thomas et al. 2002). In addition, glycosaminoglycans have been shown to interact with tropoelastin through its lysine side chains (Wu et al. 1999), regulating tropoelastin assembly (Tu & Weiss 2008).<br><br>Elastin is synthesized as a 70kDa monomer called tropoelastin, a highly hydrophobic protein composed largely of two types of domains that alternate along the polypeptide chain. Hydrophobic domains are rich in glycine, proline, alanine, leucine and valine. These amino acids occur in characteristic short (3-9 amino acids) tandem repeats, with a flexible and highly dynamic structure (Floquet et al. 2004). Unlike collagen, glycine in elastin is not rigorously positioned every 3 residues. However, glycine is distributed frequently throughout all hydrophobic domains of elastin, and displays a strong preference for inter-glycine spacing of 0-3 residues (Rauscher et al. 2006). <br><br>Elastic fibre formation involves the deposition of tropoelastin onto a template of fibrillin rich microfibrils. Recent results suggest that the first step of elastic fiber formation is the organization of small globules of elastin on the cell surface followed by globule aggregation into microfibres (Kozel et al. 2006). An important contribution to the initial stages assembly is thought to be made by the intrinsic ability of the protein to direct its own polymeric organization in a process termed 'coacervation' (Bressan et al. 1986). This self-assembly process appears to be determined by interactions between hydrophobic domains (Bressan et al. 1986, Vrhovski et al. 1997,  Bellingham et al. 2003, Cirulis & Keeley 2010) which result in alignment of the cross-linking domains, allowing the stabilization of elastin through the formation of cross-links generated through the oxidative deamination of lysine residues, catalyzed by members of the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family (Reiser et al. 1992, Mithieux & Weiss 2005). The first step in the cross-linking reaction is the oxidative formation of the delta aldehyde, known as alpha aminoadipic semialdehyde or allysine (Partridge 1963). Subsequent reactions that are probably spontaneous lead to the formation of cross-links through dehydrolysinonorleucine and allysine aldol, a trifunctional cross-link dehydromerodesmosine and two tetrafunctional cross-links desmosine and isodesmosine (Lucero & Kagan 2006), which are unique to elastin. These cross-links confer mechanical integrity and high durability. In addition to their role in self-assembly, hydrophobic domains provide elastin with its elastomeric properties, with initial studies suggesting that the elastomeric propereties of elastin are driven through changes in entropic interactions with surrounding water molecules (Hoeve & Flory 1974). <br><br>A very specific set of proteases, broadly grouped under the name elastases, is responsible for elastin remodelling (Antonicelli et al. 2007). The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are particularly important in elastin breakdown, with MMP2, 3, 9 and 12 explicitly shown to degrade elastin (Ra & Parks 2007). Nonetheless, elastin typically displays a low turnover rate under normal conditions over a lifetime (Davis 1993).

interactions	Pathway	R-HSA-216083	Reactome	The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a network of macro-molecules that underlies all epithelia and endothelia and that surrounds all connective tissue cells. This matrix provides the mechanical strength and also influences the behavior and differentiation state of cells in contact with it. The ECM are diverse in composition, but they generally comprise a mixture of fibrillar proteins, polysaccharides synthesized, secreted and organized by neighboring cells. Collagens, fibronectin, and laminins are the principal components involved in cell matrix interactions; other components, such as vitronectin, thrombospondin, and osteopontin, although less abundant, are also important adhesive molecules.<br>Integrins are the receptors that mediate cell adhesion to ECM. Integrins consists of one alpha and one beta subunit forming a noncovalently bound heterodimer. 18 alpha and 8 beta subunits have been identified in humans that combine to form 24 different receptors. <br>The integrin dimers can be broadly divided into three families consisting of the beta1, beta2/beta7, and beta3/alphaV integrins. beta1 associates with 12 alpha-subunits and can be further divided into RGD-, collagen-, or laminin binding and the related alpha4/alpha9 integrins that recognise both matrix and vascular ligands. beta2/beta7 integrins are restricted to leukocytes and mediate cell-cell rather than cell-matrix interactions, although some recognize fibrinogen. The beta3/alphaV family members are all RGD receptors and comprise aIIbb3, an important receptor on platelets, and the remaining b-subunits, which all associate with alphaV. It is the collagen receptors and leukocyte-specific integrins that contain alpha A-domains.

Collagen formation	Pathway	R-HSA-1474290	Reactome	Collagen is a family of at least 29 structural proteins derived from over 40 human genes (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004). It is the main component of connective tissue, and the most abundant protein in mammals making up about 25% to 35% of whole-body protein content. A defining feature of collagens is the formation of trimeric left-handed polyproline II-type helical collagenous regions. The packing within these regions is made possible by the presence of the smallest amino acid, glycine, at every third residue, resulting in a repeating motif Gly-X-Y where X is often proline (Pro) and Y often 4-hydroxyproline (4Hyp). Gly-Pro-Hyp is the most common triplet in collagen (Ramshaw et al. 1998). Collagen peptide chains also have non-collagenous domains, with collagen subclasses having common chain structures. Collagen fibrils are mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendon, ligament and skin. Other forms of collagen are abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral disc. In muscle tissue, collagen is a major component of the endomysium, constituting up to 6% of muscle mass. Gelatin, used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed.

On the basis of their fibre architecture in tissues, the genetically distinct collagens have been divided into subgroups. Group 1 collagens have uninterrupted triple-helical domains of about 300 nm, forming large extracellular fibrils. They are referred to as the fibril-forming collagens, consisting of collagens types I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII.  Group 2 collagens are types IV and VII, which have extended triple helices (>350 nm) with imperfections in the Gly-X-Y repeat sequences. Group 3 are the short-chain collagens. These have two subgroups. Group 3A have continuous triple-helical domains (type VI, VIII and X). Group 3B have interrupted triple-helical domains, referred to as the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT collagens, Shaw & Olsen 1991). FACITs include collagen IX, XII, XIV, XVI, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII and XXVI plus the transmembrane collagens (XIII, XVII, XXIII and XXV) and the multiple triple helix domains and interruptions (Multiplexin) collagens XV and XVIII (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004).  The non-collagenous domains of collagens have regulatory functions; several are biologically active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. Fibrillar collagen peptides all have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions, called the N- and C-propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen fibril. The intact form is referred to as a collagen propeptide, not procollagen, which is used to refer to the trimeric triple-helical precursor of collagen before the propeptides are removed. The C-propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, directs chain association during assembly of the procollagen molecule from its three constituent alpha chains (Hulmes 2002).<br><br>Fibril forming collagens are the most familiar and best studied subgroup. Collagen fibres are aggregates or bundles of collagen fibrils, which are themselves polymers of tropocollagen complexes, each consisting of three polypeptide chains known as alpha chains. Tropocollagens are considered the subunit of larger collagen structures. They are approximately 300 nm long and 1.5 nm in diameter, with a left-handed triple-helical structure, which becomes twisted into a right-handed coiled-coil 'super helix' in the collagen fibril. Tropocollagens in the extracellular space polymerize spontaneously with regularly staggered ends (Hulmes 2002). In fibrillar collagens the molecules are staggered by about 67 nm, a unit known as D that changes depending upon the hydration state. Each D-period contains slightly more than four collagen molecules so that every D-period repeat of the microfibril has a region containing five molecules in cross-section, called the 'overlap', and a region containing only four molecules, called the 'gap'. The triple-helices are arranged in a hexagonal or quasi-hexagonal array in cross-section, in both the gap and overlap regions (Orgel et al. 2006). Collagen molecules cross-link covalently to each other via lysine and hydroxylysine side chains. These cross-links are unusual, occuring only in collagen and elastin, a related protein.<br><br>The macromolecular structures of collagen are diverse. Several group 3 collagens associate with larger collagen fibers, serving as molecular bridges which stabilize the organization of the extracellular matrix. Type IV collagen is arranged in an interlacing network within the dermal-epidermal junction and vascular basement membranes. Type VI collagen forms distinct microfibrils called beaded filaments. Type VII collagen forms anchoring fibrils. Type VIII and X collagens form hexagonal networks. Type XVII collagen is a component of hemidesmosomes where it is complexed wtih alpha6Beta4 integrin, plectin, and laminin-332 (de Pereda et al. 2009). Type XXIX collagen has been recently reported to be a putative epidermal collagen with highest expression in suprabasal layers (Soderhall et al. 2007). Collagen fibrils/aggregates arranged in varying combinations and concentrations in different tissues provide specific tissue properties. In bone, collagen triple helices lie in a parallel, staggered array with 40 nm gaps between the ends of the tropocollagen subunits, which probably serve as nucleation sites for the deposition of  crystals of the mineral component, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) with some phosphate. Collagen structure affects cell-cell and cell-matrix communication, tissue construction in growth and repair, and is changed in development and disease (Sweeney et al. 2006, Twardowski et al. 2007). A single collagen fibril can be heterogeneous along its axis, with significantly different mechanical properties in the gap and overlap regions, correlating with the different molecular organizations in these regions (Minary-Jolandan & Yu 2009).
