description: The extracellular matrix is a component of all mammalian tissues, a network
  consisting largely of the fibrous proteins collagen, elastin and associated-microfibrils,
  fibronectin and laminins embedded in a viscoelastic gel of anionic proteoglycan
  polymers. It performs many functions in addition to its structural role; as a major
  component of the cellular microenvironment it influences cell behaviours such as
  proliferation, adhesion and migration, and regulates cell differentiation and death
  (Hynes 2009). <br><br>ECM composition is highly heterogeneous and dynamic, being
  constantly remodeled (Frantz et al. 2010) and modulated, largely by matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) and growth factors that bind to the ECM influencing the synthesis, crosslinking
  and degradation of ECM components (Hynes 2009). ECM remodeling is involved in the
  regulation of cell differentiation processes such as the establishment and maintenance
  of stem cell niches, branching morphogenesis, angiogenesis, bone remodeling, and
  wound repair. Redundant mechanisms modulate the expression and function of ECM modifying
  enzymes. Abnormal ECM dynamics can lead to deregulated cell proliferation and invasion,
  failure of cell death, and loss of cell differentiation, resulting in congenital
  defects and pathological processes including tissue fibrosis and cancer.<br><br>Collagen
  is the most abundant fibrous protein within the ECM constituting up to 30% of total
  protein in multicellular animals. Collagen provides tensile strength. It associates
  with elastic fibres, composed of elastin and fibrillin microfibrils, which give
  tissues the ability to recover after stretching. Other ECM proteins such as fibronectin,
  laminins, and matricellular proteins participate as connectors or linking proteins
  (Daley et al. 2008).<br><br>Chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and keratan sulfate
  proteoglycans are structural components associated with collagen fibrils (Scott
  & Haigh 1985; Scott & Orford 1981), serving to tether the fibril to the surrounding
  matrix. Decorin belongs to the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan family (SLRPs)
  which also includes biglycan, fibromodulin, lumican and asporin. All appear to be
  involved in collagen fibril formation and matrix assembly (Ameye & Young 2002).
  <br><br>ECM proteins such as osteonectin (SPARC), osteopontin and thrombospondins
  -1 and -2, collectively referred to as matricellular proteins (reviewed in Mosher
  & Adams 2012) appear to modulate cell-matrix interactions. In general they induce
  de-adhesion, characterized by disruption of focal adhesions and a reorganization
  of actin stress fibers (Bornstein 2009).  Thrombospondin (TS)-1 and -2 bind MMP2.
  The resulting complex is endocytosed by the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein (LRP), clearing MMP2 from the ECM (Yang et al. 2001).<br><br>Osteopontin
  (SPP1, bone sialoprotein-1) interacts with collagen and fibronectin (Mukherjee et
  al. 1995). It also contains several cell adhesive domains that interact with integrins
  and CD44.<br><br>Aggrecan is the predominant ECM proteoglycan in cartilage (Hardingham
  & Fosang 1992). Its relatives include versican, neurocan and brevican (Iozzo 1998).
  In articular cartilage the major non-fibrous macromolecules are aggrecan, hyaluronan
  and hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 (HAPLN1). The high negative charge
  density of these molecules leads to the binding of large amounts of water (Bruckner
  2006). Hyaluronan is bound by several large proteoglycans proteoglycans belonging
  to the hyalectan family that form high-molecular weight aggregates (Roughley 2006),
  accounting for the turgid nature of  cartilage. <br><br>The most significant enzymes
  in ECM remodeling are the Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase
  with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) families (Cawston & Young 2010). Other notable
  ECM degrading enzymes include plasmin and cathepsin G. Many ECM proteinases are
  initially present as precursors, activated by proteolytic processing. MMP precursors
  include an amino prodomain which masks the catalytic Zn-binding motif (Page-McCawet
  al. 2007). This can be removed by other proteinases, often other MMPs. ECM proteinases
  can be inactivated by degradation, or blocked by inhibitors. Some of these inhibitors,
  including alpha2-macroglobulin, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, and alpha1-chymotrypsin
  can inhibit a large variety of proteinases (Woessner & Nagase 2000). The tissue
  inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are potent MMP inhibitors (Brew & Nagase
  2010).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1474244

  - On the basis of their fibre architecture in tissues, the genetically distinct
    collagens have been divided into subgroups. Group 1 collagens have uninterrupted
    triple-helical domains of about 300 nm, forming large extracellular fibrils. They
    are referred to as the fibril-forming collagens, consisting of collagens types
    I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV and XXVII.  Group 2 collagens are types IV and VII, which
    have extended triple helices (>350 nm) with imperfections in the Gly-X-Y repeat
    sequences. Group 3 are the short-chain collagens. These have two subgroups. Group
    3A have continuous triple-helical domains (type VI, VIII and X). Group 3B have
    interrupted triple-helical domains, referred to as the fibril-associated collagens
    with interrupted triple helices (FACIT collagens, Shaw & Olsen 1991). FACITs include
    collagen IX, XII, XIV, XVI, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII and XXVI plus the transmembrane
    collagens (XIII, XVII, XXIII and XXV) and the multiple triple helix domains and
    interruptions (Multiplexin) collagens XV and XVIII (Myllyharju & Kivirikko 2004).  The
    non-collagenous domains of collagens have regulatory functions; several are biologically
    active when cleaved from the main peptide chain. Fibrillar collagen peptides all
    have a large triple helical domain (COL1) bordered by N and C terminal extensions,
    called the N- and C-propeptides, which are cleaved prior to formation of the collagen
    fibril. The intact form is referred to as a collagen propeptide, not procollagen,
    which is used to refer to the trimeric triple-helical precursor of collagen before
    the propeptides are removed. The C-propeptide, also called the NC1 domain, directs
    chain association during assembly of the procollagen molecule from its three constituent
    alpha chains (Hulmes 2002).<br><br>Fibril forming collagens are the most familiar
    and best studied subgroup. Collagen fibres are aggregates or bundles of collagen
    fibrils, which are themselves polymers of tropocollagen complexes, each consisting
    of three polypeptide chains known as alpha chains. Tropocollagens are considered
    the subunit of larger collagen structures. They are approximately 300 nm long
    and 1.5 nm in diameter, with a left-handed triple-helical structure, which becomes
    twisted into a right-handed coiled-coil 'super helix' in the collagen fibril.
    Tropocollagens in the extracellular space polymerize spontaneously with regularly
    staggered ends (Hulmes 2002). In fibrillar collagens the molecules are staggered
    by about 67 nm, a unit known as D that changes depending upon the hydration state.
    Each D-period contains slightly more than four collagen molecules so that every
    D-period repeat of the microfibril has a region containing five molecules in cross-section,
    called the 'overlap', and a region containing only four molecules, called the
    'gap'. The triple-helices are arranged in a hexagonal or quasi-hexagonal array
    in cross-section, in both the gap and overlap regions (Orgel et al. 2006). Collagen
    molecules cross-link covalently to each other via lysine and hydroxylysine side
    chains. These cross-links are unusual, occuring only in collagen and elastin,
    a related protein.<br><br>The macromolecular structures of collagen are diverse.
    Several group 3 collagens associate with larger collagen fibers, serving as molecular
    bridges which stabilize the organization of the extracellular matrix. Type IV
    collagen is arranged in an interlacing network within the dermal-epidermal junction
    and vascular basement membranes. Type VI collagen forms distinct microfibrils
    called beaded filaments. Type VII collagen forms anchoring fibrils. Type VIII
    and X collagens form hexagonal networks. Type XVII collagen is a component of
    hemidesmosomes where it is complexed wtih alpha6Beta4 integrin, plectin, and laminin-332
    (de Pereda et al. 2009). Type XXIX collagen has been recently reported to be a
    putative epidermal collagen with highest expression in suprabasal layers (Soderhall
    et al. 2007). Collagen fibrils/aggregates arranged in varying combinations and
    concentrations in different tissues provide specific tissue properties. In bone,
    collagen triple helices lie in a parallel, staggered array with 40 nm gaps between
    the ends of the tropocollagen subunits, which probably serve as nucleation sites
    for the deposition of  crystals of the mineral component, hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2)
    with some phosphate. Collagen structure affects cell-cell and cell-matrix communication,
    tissue construction in growth and repair, and is changed in development and disease
    (Sweeney et al. 2006, Twardowski et al. 2007). A single collagen fibril can be
    heterogeneous along its axis, with significantly different mechanical properties
    in the gap and overlap regions, correlating with the different molecular organizations
    in these regions (Minary-Jolandan & Yu 2009).

  - 'Syndecans bind a wide variety of soluble and insoluble ligands, inckluding extracellular
    matrix components, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytokines, and proteinases.
    As the cleaved ectodomains of syndecans retain the ability to bind ligands, ectodomain
    shedding is a mechanism for releasing soluble effectors that may compete for ligands
    with their cell-bound counterparts (Kainulainen et al. 1998). Shed  ectodomains
    are found in inflammatory fluids (Subramanian et al. 1997) and may induce the
    proliferation of cancer cells (Maeda et al. 2004). '
