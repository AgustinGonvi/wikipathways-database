description: 'Coagulation is a complex process by which blood forms clots. It is an
  important part of hemostasis (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel),
  wherein a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet and fibrin-containing
  clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel. Disorders of coagulation
  can lead to an increased risk of bleeding (hemorrhage) or clotting (thrombosis).  Source:
