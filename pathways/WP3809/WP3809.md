description: Each strand of the circular mitochondrial genome is transcribed to yield
  long polycistronic transcripts, the heavy strand transcript and the light strand
  transcript, which are then cleaved to yield tRNAs, rRNAs, and mRNAs (Mercer et al.
  2011, reviewed in Suzuki et al. 2011, Rossmanith 2012, Powell et al. 2015). Mitochondrial
  RNase P, which is completely distinct from nuclear RNase P in having different protein
  subunits and no RNA component, cleaves at the 5' ends of tRNAs. RNase Z, an isoform
  of ELAC2 in mitochondria, cleaves at the 3' ends of tRNAs. (A different isoform
  of ELAC2 serves as RNase Z in the nucleus.) Unknown nucleases make additional cleavages
  near the 5' end of MT-CO3, the 5' end of CO1, the 5' end of CYB, and the 3' end
  of ND6. TRNT1 (CCA-adding enzyme) then post-transcriptionally polymerizes the universal
  acceptor sequence CCA onto the 3' ends of the cleaved tRNAs. In yeast, plants, and
  protozoa additional tRNAs encoded in the nucleus are imported into mitochondria
  from the cytosol (reviewed in Schneider 2011), however human mitochondria encode
  a complete complement of 22 tRNAs required for translation and tRNA import has not
  been observed in mammals. Mutations that affect mitochondrial tRNA processing cause
  human diseases that are generally characterized by abnormalities in energy-requiring
  tissues such as brain and muscle (reviewed in Suzuki et al. 2011, Sarin and Leidel
  2014).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6785470
