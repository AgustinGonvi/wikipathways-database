  "description": "Riboflavin is the precursor of the cofactors FMN and FAD, which are used by many oxidoreductases from the cytosol, plastids, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. In plants riboflavin synthesis takes place solely in plastids, from the precursors GTP and D-ribulose 5-phosphate. Riboflavin can be converted successively to FMN and FAD within plastids themselves, in the cytosol, or in mitochondria. There are also opposite pathways in which FAD and FMN are hydrolysed back to riboflavin.  The details of the riboflavin, FAD, and FMN biosyntheses (especially their compartmentalization) in plants are far from being elucidated. This diagram is an attempt to capture the current state of the field",
