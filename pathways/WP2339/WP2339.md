description: Riboflavin is the precursor of the cofactors FMN and FAD, which are used
  by many oxidoreductases from the cytosol, plastids, mitochondria, and peroxisomes.
  In plants riboflavin synthesis takes place solely in plastids, from the precursors
  GTP and D-ribulose 5-phosphate. Riboflavin can be converted successively to FMN
  and FAD within plastids themselves, in the cytosol, or in mitochondria. There are
  also opposite pathways in which FAD and FMN are hydrolysed back to riboflavin.  The
  details of the riboflavin, FAD, and FMN biosyntheses (especially their compartmentalization)
  in plants are far from being elucidated. This diagram is an attempt to capture the
  current state of the field
