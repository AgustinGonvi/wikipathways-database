  "description": "The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is the central signalling mechanism for many growth factors and cytokines.  JAK activation stimulates cell proliferation, differentiation, cell migration, and apoptosis. These events are critical to immune development, adipogenesis, sexually dimorphic growth, and other processes.  Mutations of the JAK/STAT pathway reduces these processes and causes many diseases, including: inflammatory diseases, erythrocytosis, gigantism, and different kinds of leukemia.
