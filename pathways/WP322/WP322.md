description: Osteoblasts are specialized, terminally differentiated cell of mesenchymal
  origin. They create dense, crosslinked collagen and also specialized proteins, including
  osteocalcin and osteopontin. This pathway illustrates various signaling pathways
  in osteoblasts relevant to collagen and protein production.  Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP322
