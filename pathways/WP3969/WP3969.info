Description: In this proposed model, H19 interacts with macroH2A, and this may consequently lead to de-repression of genes including CDK8, CDK4, and CCND1. Increased CDK4-cyclin D1 complex phosphorylates Rb to disrupt Rb-E2F1 interaction, leading to E2F1 activation. The increase of CDK8 expression enhances the function of mediator complex including MED1, and facilitates the gene regulation by ï¿½-catenin. These downstream targets could work in a synergistic way of promoting cell proliferation and increasing cell motility in CRC.
