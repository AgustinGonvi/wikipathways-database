description: Thrombin activates proteinase activated receptors (PARs) that signal
  through heterotrimeric G proteins of the G12/13 and Gq families, thereby connecting
  to a host of intracellular signaling pathways. Thrombin activates PARs by cleaving
  an N-terminal peptide that then binds to the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane
  signaling. Intermolecular ligation of one PAR molecule by another can occur but
  is less efficient than self-ligation. A synthetic peptide of sequence SFLLRN, the
  first six amino acids of the new N-terminus generated when thrombin cleaves PAR1,
  can activate PAR1 independent of protease and receptor cleavage. PARs are key to
  platelet activation. Four PARs have been identified, of which PARs 1 ,3 and 4 are
  substrates for thrombin. In humans PAR 1 is the predominant thrombin receptor followed
  by PAR4 which is less responsive to thrombin. PAR 3 is not considered important
  for human platelet responses as it is minimally expressed, though this is not the
  case for mouse. PAR2 is not expressed in platelets. In mouse platelets, Gq is necessary
  for platelet secretion and aggregation in response to thrombin but is not necessary
  for thrombin-triggered shape change. G13 appears to contribute to platelet aggregation
  as well as shape change in response to low concentrations of thrombin but to be
  unnecessary at higher agonist concentrations; G12 appears to be dispensable for
  thrombin signaling in platelets. G alpha (q) activates phospholipase C beta thereby
  triggering phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization and protein kinase
  C activation. This provides a path to calcium-regulated kinases and phosphatases,
  GEFs, MAP kinase cassettes and other proteins that mediate cellular responses ranging
  from granule secretion, integrin activation, and aggregation in platelets. Gbeta:gamma
  subunits can activate phosphoinositide-3 kinase and other lipid modifying enzymes,
  protein kinases, and channels. PAR1 activation indirectly leads to activation of
  cell surface 'sheddases' that liberate ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, providing
  a link between thrombin and receptor tyrosine kinases involved in cell growth and
  differentiation. The pleiotrophic effects of PAR activation are consistent with
  many of thrombin's diverse actions on cells.   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=456926
