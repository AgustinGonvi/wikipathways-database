description: The IL-1 family of cytokines that interact with the Type 1 IL-1R include
  IL-1Î± (IL1A), IL-1Î² (IL1B) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL1RAP).
  IL1RAP is synthesized with a signal peptide and secreted as a mature protein via
  the classical secretory pathway.  IL1A and IL1B are synthesised as cytoplasmic precursors
  (pro-IL1A and pro-IL1B) in activated cells. They have no signal sequence, precluding
  secretion via the classical ER-Golgi route (Rubartelli et al. 1990). Processing
  of pro-IL1B to the active form requires caspase-1 (Thornberry et al. 1992), which
  is itself activated by a molecular scaffold termed the inflammasome (Martinon et
  al. 2002). Processing and release of IL1B are thought to be closely linked, because
  mature IL1B is only seen inside inflammatory cells just prior to release (Brough
  et al. 2003). It has been reported that in monocytes a fraction of cellular IL1B
  is released by the regulated secretion of late endosomes and early lysosomes, and
  that this may represent a cellular compartment where caspase-1 processing of pro-IL1B
  takes place (Andrei et al. 1999). Shedding of microvesicles from the plasma membrane
  has also been proposed as a mechanism of secretion (MacKenzie et al. 2001). These
  proposals superceded previous models in which non-specific release due to cell lysis
  and passage through a plasma membrane pore were considered. However, there is evidence
  in the literature that supports all of these mechanisms and there is still controversy
  over how IL1B exits from cells (Brough & Rothwell 2007). A calpain-like potease
  has been reported to be important for the processing of  pro-IL1A, but much less
  is known about how IL1A is released from cells and what specific roles it plays
  in biology.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=448706
