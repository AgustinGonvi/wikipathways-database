  "description": "DNAX activation protein of 12kDa (DAP12) is an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing adapter molecule that transduces activating signals in natural killer (NK) and myeloid cells. It mediates signalling for multiple cell-surface receptors expressed by these cells, associating with receptor chains through complementary charged transmembrane amino acids that form a salt-bridge in the context of the hydrophobic lipid bilayer (Lanier et al. 1998). DAP12 homodimers associate with a variety of receptors expressed by macrophages, monocytes and myeloid cells including TREM2, Siglec H and SIRP-beta, as well as activating KIR, LY49 and the NKG2C proteins expressed by NK cells. DAP12 is expressed at the cell surface, with most of the protein lying on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Turnbull & Colonna 2007, Tessarz & Cerwenka 2008).
