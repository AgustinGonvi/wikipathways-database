description: Schwann cells are glial cells of the peripheral nervous system that ensheath
  the peripheral nerves within a compacted lipid-rich myelin structure that is required
  for optimal transduction of nerve signals in motor and sensory nerves. Schwann cells
  develop from the neural crest in a differentiation process driven by factors derived
  from the Schwann cell itself, from the adjacent neuron or from the extracellular
  matrix (reviewed in Jessen and Mirsky, 2005). Upon peripheral nerve injury, mature
  Schwann cells can form repair cells that allow peripheral nerve regeneration through
  myelin phagocytosis and remyelination of the peripheral nerve. This process in some
  ways recapitulates the maturation of immature Schwann cells during development (reviewed
  in Jessen and Mirsky, 2016).  Mature, fully myelinated Schwann cells exhibit longitudinal
  and radial polarization. The axon-distal abaxonal membrane interacts with elements
  of the basal lamina through integrins and lamins and in this way resembles the basolateral
  domain of polarized epithelial cells. In contrast, the axon-proximal adaxonal membrane
  resembles the apical domain of an epithelial cell, and is enriched with adhesion
  molecules and receptors that mediate interaction with ligands from the axon (reviewed
  in Salzer, 2015).<br>Schwann cells express a number of Schwann-cell specific proteins,
  including components of the myelin sheath such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and
  myelin protein zero (MPZ). In addition, Schwann cells have high lipid content relative
  to other membranes, and are enriched in galactosphingolipids, cholesterol and saturated
  long chain fatty acids (reviewed in Garbay et al, 2000). This protein and lipid
  profile is driven by a Schwann cell myelination transcriptional program controlled
  by master regulators SOX10, POU3F1 and EGR2, among others (reviewed in Svaren and
  Meijer, 2008; Stolt and Wegner, 2016).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9619665
