description: Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-kinase protein 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3-dependent
  necrosis is called necroptosis or programmed necrosis. The kinase activities of
  RIPK1 and RIPK3 are essential for the necroptotic cell death in human, mouse cell
  lines and genetic mice models (Cho YS et al. 2009; He S et al. 2009, 2011; Zhang
  DW et al. 2009; McQuade T et al. 2013; Newton et al. 2014). The initiation of necroptosis
  can be stimulated by the same death ligands that activate extrinsic apoptotic signaling
  pathway, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, Fas ligand (FasL), and TRAIL
  (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) or toll like receptors 3 and 4 ligands (Holler
  N et al. 2000; He S et al. 2009; Feoktistova M et al. 2011; Voigt S et al. 2014).
  In contrast to apoptosis, necroptosis represents a form of cell death that is optimally
  induced when caspases are inhibited (Holler N et al. 2000; Hopkins-Donaldson S et
  al. 2000; Sawai H 2014). Specific inhibitors of caspase-independent necrosis, necrostatins,
  have recently been identified (Degterev A et al. 2005, 2008). Necrostatins have
  been shown to inhibit the kinase activity of RIPK1 (Degterev A et al. 2008). Importantly,
  cell death of apoptotic morphology can be shifted to a necrotic phenotype when caspase
  8 activity is compromised, otherwise active caspase 8 blocks necroptosis by the
  proteolytic cleavage of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Kalai M et al. 2002; Degterev A et al.
  2008; Lin Y et al. 1999; Feng S et al. 2007). When caspase activity is inhibited
  under certain pathophysiological conditions or by pharmacological agents, deubiquitinated
  RIPK1 is engaged in physical and functional interactions with the cognate kinase
  RIPK3 leading to formation of necrosome, a necroptosis-inducing complex consisting
  of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (Sawai H 2013; Moquin DM et al. 2013; Kalai M et al. 2002; Cho
  YS et al. 2009, He S et al. 2009, Zhang DW et al. 2009). Within the necrosome RIPK1
  and RIPK3 bind to each other through their RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM)
  domains. The RHIMs can facilitate RIPK1:RIPK3 oligomerization, allowing them to
  form amyloid-like fibrillar structures (Li J et al. 2012; Mompean M et al. 2018).
  RIPK3 in turn interacts with mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) (Sun
  L et al. 2012; Zhao J et al. 2012; Murphy JM et al. 2013; Chen W et al. 2013). The
  precise mechanism of MLKL activation by RIPK3 is incompletely understood and may
  vary across species (Davies KA et al. 2020). Mouse MLKL activation relies on transient
  engagement of RIPK3 to facilitate phosphorylation of the pseudokinase domain (Murphy
  JM et al. 2013; Petrie EJ et al. 2019a), while it appears that stable recruitment
  of human MLKL by necrosomal RIPK3 is an additional crucial step in human MLKL activation
  (Davies KA et al. 2018; Petrie EJ et al. 2018, 2019b). RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation
  is thought to initiate MLKL oligomerization, membrane translocation and membrane
  disruption (Sun L et al. 2012; Wang H et al. 2014; Petrie EJ et al. 2020; Samson
  AL et al. 2020). Studies in human cell lines suggest that upon induction of necroptosis
  MLKL shifts to the plasma membrane and membranous organelles such as mitochondria,
  lysosome, endosome and ER (Wang H et al. 2014), but it is trafficking via a Golgi-microtubule-actin-dependent
  mechanism that facilitates plasma membrane translocation, where membrane disruption
  causes death (Samson AL et al. 2020). The mechanisms of necroptosis regulation and
  execution downstream of MLKL remain elusive. The precise oligomeric form of MLKL
  that mediates plasma membrane disruption has been highly debated (Cai Z et al. 2014;
  Chen X et al. 2014; Dondelinger Y et al. 2014; Wang H et al. 2014; Petrie EJ et
  al. 2017, 2018; Samson AL et al. 2020 ). However, microscopy data revealed that
  MLKL assembles into higher molecular weight species upon cytoplasmic necrosomes
  within human cells, and upon phosphorylation by RIPK3, MLKL is trafficked to the
  plasma membrane (Samson AL et al. 2020). At the plasma membrane, phospho-MLKL forms
  heterogeneous higher order assemblies, which are thought to permeabilize cells,
  leading to release of DAMPs to invoke inflammatory responses. While RIPK1, RIPK3
  and MLKL are the core signaling components in the necroptosis pathway, many additional
  molecules have been proposed to positively and negatively tune the signaling pathway.
  Currently, this picture is evolving rapidly as new modulators continue to be discovered.<p>The

  - 'Influenza viruses belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae; viruses with segmented
    RNA genomes that are negative sense and single-stranded (Baltimore 1971). Influenza
    virus strains are named according to their type (A, B, or C), the species from
    which the virus was isolated (omitted if human), location of isolate, the number
    of the isolate, the year of isolation, and in the case of influenza A viruses,
    the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subtype. For example, the virus of
    H5N1 subtype isolated from chickens in Hong Kong in 1997 is: influenza A/chicken/Hong
    Kong/220/97(H5N1) virus. Currently 16 different hemagglutinin (H1 to H16) subtypes
    and 9 different neuraminidase (N1 to N9) subtypes are known for influenza A viruses.
    Most human disease is due to influenza viruses of the A type. The events of influenza
    infection have been annotated in Reactome primarily use protein and genome references
    to the Influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 strain.'

  - The influenza virus particle initially associates with a human host cell by binding
    to sialic acid receptors on the host cell surface. Sialic acids are found on many
    vertebrate cells and numerous viruses make use of this ubiquitous receptor. The
    bound virus is endocytosed by one of four distinct mechanisms. Once endocytosed
    the low endosomal pH sets in motion a number of steps that lead to viral membrane
    fusion mediated by the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein, and the eventual release
    of the uncoated viral ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytosol of the host cell.
    The ribonucleoprotein complex is transported through the nuclear pore into the
    nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the incoming negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) is
    transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) by a primer-dependent mechanism. Replication
    occurs via a two step process. A full-length complementary RNA (cRNA), a positive-sense
    copy of the vRNA, is first made and this in turn is used as a template to produce
    more vRNA. The viral proteins are expressed and processed and eventually assemble
    with vRNAs at what will become the budding sites on the host cell membrane. The
    viral protein and ribonucleoprotein complexes are assembled into complete viral
    particles and bud from the host cell, enveloped in the host cell's membrane.<p>

  - Infection of a human host cell with influenza virus triggers an array of defensive
    host processes. This coevolution has driven the development of host processes
    that interfere with viral replication, notably the production of type I interferon.
    At the some time the virus counters these responses with the viral NS1 protein
    playing a central role in the viral response to the host cells defense.
