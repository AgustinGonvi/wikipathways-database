description: The interleukin-2 family (also called the common gamma chain cytokine family) consists of interleukin (IL)2, IL9, IL15 and IL21. Although sometimes considered to be within this family, the IL4 and IL7 receptors can form complexes with other receptor chains and are represented separately in Reactome. Receptors of this family associate with JAK1 and JAK3, primarily activating STAT5, although certain family members can also activate STAT1, STAT3 or STAT6.
