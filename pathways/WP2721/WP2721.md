description: The NOTCH4 gene locus was discovered as a frequent site of insertion
  for the proviral genome of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) (Gallahan and Callahan
  1987). MMTV-insertion results in aberrant expression of the mouse mammary tumor
  gene int-3, which was subsequently discovered to represent the intracellular domain
  of Notch4 (Robbins et al. 1992, Uyttendaele et al. 1996).<br><br>NOTCH4 is prevalently
  expressed in endothelial cells (Uyttendaele et al. 1996). DLL4 and JAG1 act as ligands
  for NOTCH4 in human endothelial cells (Shawber et al. 2003, Shawber et al. 2007),
  but DLL4- and JAG1-mediated activation of NOTCH4 have not been confirmed in all
  cell types tested (Aste-Amezaga et al. 2010, James et al. 2014). The gamma secretase
  complex cleaves activated NOTCH4 receptor to release the intracellular domain fragment
  (NICD4) (Saxena et al. 2001, Das et al. 2004). NICD4 traffics to the nucleus where
  it acts as a transcription factor and stimulates expression of NOTCH target genes
  HES1, HES5, HEY1 and HEY2, as well as VEGFR3 and ACTA2 (Lin et al. 2002, Raafat
  et al.2004, Tsunematsu et al. 2004, Shawber et al. 2007, Tang et al. 2008, Bargo
  et al. 2010). NOTCH4 signaling can be downregulated by AKT1 phosphorylation-induced
  cytoplasmic retention (Ramakrishnan et al. 2015) as well as proteasome-dependent
  degradation upon FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination (Wu et al. 2001, Tsunematsu et al.
  2004).<br><br>NOTCH4 was reported to inhibit NOTCH1 signaling in-cis, by binding
  to NOTCH1 and interfering with the S1 cleavage of NOTCH1, thus preventing production
  of functional NOTCH1 heterodimers at the cell surface (James et al. 2014).<br><br>NOTCH4
  is involved in development of the vascular system. Overexpression of constitutively
  active Notch4 in mouse embryonic vasculature results in abnormal vessel structure
  and patterning (Uyttendaele et al. 2001). NOTCH4 may act to inhibit apoptosis of
  endothelial cells (MacKenzie et al. 2004).<br><br>Expression of int-3 interferes
  with normal mammary gland development in mice and promotes tumorigenesis. The phenotype
  of mice expressing int-3 in mammary glands is dependent on the presence of Rbpj
  (Raafat et al. 2009). JAG1 and NOTCH4 are upregulated in human ER+ breast cancers
  resistant to anti-estrogen therapy, which correlates with elevated expression of
  NOTCH target genes HES1, HEY1 and HEY2,  and is associated with increased population
  of breast cancer stem cells and distant metastases (Simoes et al. 2015). Development
  of int-3-induced mammary tumours  in mice depends on Kit and Pdgfra signaling (Raafat
  et al. 2006) and on int-3-induced activaton of NFKB signaling (Raafat et al. 2017).
  In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high NOTCH4 expression correlates
  with elevated HEY1 levels, increased cell proliferation and survival, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) phenotype and cisplatin resistance (Fukusumi et al. 2018). In melanoma,
  however, exogenous NOTCH4 expression correlates with mesenchymal-to-epithelial-like
  transition and reduced invasiveness (Bonyadi Rad et al. 2016). NOTCH4 is frequently
  overexpressed in gastric cancer. Increased NOTCH4 levels correlate with activation
  of WNT signaling and gastric cancer progression (Qian et al. 2015).<br><br>NOTCH4
  is expressed in adipocytes and may promote adipocyte differentiation (Lai et al.
  2013).<br><br>During Dengue virus infection, DLL1, DLL4, NOTCH4 and HES1 are upregulated
  in interferon-beta (INFB) dependent manner (Li et al. 2015). NOTCH4 signaling may
  be affected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, as the EBV protein BARF0 binds
  to NOTCH4 (Kusano and Raab-Traub 2001).   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9013694
