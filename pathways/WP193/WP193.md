description: 'Signaling pathway of the Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (Homo sapiens)
  also know as C-Met. The C-Met activation results in the stimulation of a variety
  of intracellular signalling pathways, which regulate several processes such as:
  motility, migration, proliferation and invasion.'
