ATF6 (ATF6-alpha)
activates chaperone
genes	Pathway	R-HSA-381183	Reactome	The N-terminal fragment of ATF6-alpha contains a bZIP domain and binds the sequence CCACG in ER Stress Response Elements (ERSEs). ATF6-alpha binds ERSEs together with the heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y, which binds the sequence CCAAT in the ERSEs, and together the two factors activate transcription of ER stress-responsive genes. Evidence from overexpression and knockdowns indicates that ATF6-alpha is a potent activator but its homolog ATF6-beta is not and ATF6-beta may actually reduce expression of ER stress proteins.

XBP1(S) activates
chaperone genes	Pathway	R-HSA-381038	Reactome	Xbp-1 (S) binds the sequence CCACG in ER Stress Responsive Elements (ERSE, consensus sequence CCAAT (N)9 CCACG) located upstream from many genes. The ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y, a heterotrimer, binds the CCAAT portion of the ERSE and together the IRE1-alpha: NF-Y complex activates transcription of a set of chaperone genes including DNAJB9, EDEM, RAMP4, p58IPK, and others. This results in an increase in protein folding activity in the ER.

p-S724-IRE1 dimer	Complex	R-HSA-381154	Reactome	After juxtaposition of the luminal N-termini of IRE1 to form the IRE1 homodimer, the cytoplasmic C-terminal kinase domains of the IRE1 molecules associate and transphosphorylate each other's A-loop domains. This causes a change in conformation that allows binding of ADP.

p-S724-IRE1
dimer:ADP	Complex	R-HSA-381078	Reactome	Phosphorylated IRE1 homodimers preferentially bind ADP (as opposed to ATP) and this binding promotes association of the cytoplasmic C-termini. Crystallographic evidence indicates that unphosphorylated A-loops of IRE1 interfere with nucleotide binding thus trans-autophosphorylation is a prerequisite to nucleotide binding.
