description: 'The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a regulatory system that protects
  the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) from overload. The UPR is provoked by the accumulation
  of improperly folded protein in the ER during times of unusually high secretion
  activity. Analysis of mutants with altered UPR, however, shows that the UPR is also
  required for normal development and function of secretory cells.<br>One level at
  which the URP operates is transcriptional and translational regulation: mobilization
  of ATF6, ATF6B, CREB3 factors and IRE1 leads to increased transcription of genes
  encoding chaperones, while mobilization of PERK (pancreatic eIF2alpha kinase, EIF2AK3)
  leads to phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha and global
  down-regulation of protein synthesis.<br>ATF6, ATF6B, and CREB3 factors (CREB3 (LUMAN),
  CREB3L1 (OASIS), CREB3L2 (BBF2H7, Tisp40), CREB3L3 (CREB-H), and CREB3L4 (CREB4))
  are membrane-bound transcription activators that respond to ER stress by transiting
  from the ER membrane to the Golgi membrane where their transmembrane domains are
  cleaved, releasing their cytosolic domains to transit to the nucleus and activate
  transcription of target genes. IRE1, also a resident of the ER membrane, dimerizes
  and autophosphorylates in response to ER stress. The activated IRE1 then catalyzes
  unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA to yield an XBP1 isoform that is targeted to
  the nucleus and activates chaperone genes.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=381119
