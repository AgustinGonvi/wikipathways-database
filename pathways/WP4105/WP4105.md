description: The RUNX1 (AML1) transcription factor is a master regulator of hematopoiesis
  (Ichikawa et al. 2004) that is frequently translocated in acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML), resulting in formation of fusion proteins with altered transactivation profiles
  (Lam and Zhang 2012, Ichikawa et al. 2013). In addition to RUNX1, its heterodimerization
  partner CBFB is also frequently mutated in AML (Shigesada et al. 2004, Mangan and
  Speck 2011).<br>The core domain of CBFB binds to the Runt domain of RUNX1, resulting
  in formation of the RUNX1:CBFB heterodimer. CBFB does not interact with DNA directly.
  The Runt domain of RUNX1 mediated both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFB
  (Tahirov et al. 2001), while RUNX1 regions that flank the Runt domain are involved
  in transactivation (reviewed in Zhang et al. 2003) and negative regulation (autoinhibition).
  CBFB facilitates RUNX1 binding to DNA by stabilizing Runt domain regions that interact
  with the major and minor grooves of the DNA (Tahirov et al. 2001, Backstrom et al.
  2002, Bartfeld et al. 2002). The transactivation domain of RUNX1 is located C-terminally
  to the Runt domain and is followed by the negative regulatory domain. Autoinhibiton
  of RUNX1 is relieved by interaction with CBFB (Kanno et al. 1998).<br>Transcriptional
  targets of the RUNX1:CBFB complex involve genes that regulate self-renewal of hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSCs) (Zhao et al. 2014), as well as commitment and differentiation
  of many hematopoietic progenitors, including myeloid (Friedman 2009) and megakaryocytic
  progenitors (Goldfarb 2009), regulatory T lymphocytes (Wong et al. 2011) and B lymphocytes
  (Boller and Grosschedl 2014).<br>RUNX1 binds to promoters of many genes involved
  in ribosomal biogenesis (Ribi) and is thought to stimulate their transcription.
  RUNX1 loss-of-function decreases ribosome biogenesis and translation in hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). RUNX1 loss-of-function is therefore associated
  with a slow growth, but at the same time it results in reduced apoptosis and increases
  resistance of cells to genotoxic and endoplasmic reticulum stress, conferring an
  overall selective advantage to RUNX1 deficient HSPCs (Cai et al. 2015).<br>RUNX1
  is implicated as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. RUNX1 forms a complex with
  the activated estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and regulates expression of estrogen-responsive
  genes (Chimge and Frenkel 2013).<br>RUNX1 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian
  carcinoma where it may contribute to cell proliferation, migration and invasion
  (Keita et al. 2013).<br>RUNX1 may cooperate with TP53 in transcriptional activation
  of TP53 target genes upon DNA damage (Wu et al. 2013).<br>RUNX1 is needed for the
  maintenance of skeletal musculature (Wang et al. 2005).<br>During mouse embryonic
  development, Runx1 is expressed in most nociceptive sensory neurons, which are involved
  in the perception of pain. In adult mice, Runx1 is expressed only in nociceptive
  sensory neurons that express the Ret receptor and is involved in regulation of expression
  of genes encoding ion channels (sodium-gated, ATP-gated and hydrogen ion-gated)
  and receptors (thermal receptors, opioid receptor MOR and the Mrgpr class of G protein
  coupled receptors). Mice lacking Runx1 show defective perception of thermal and
  neuropathic pain (Chen CL et al. 2006). Runx1 is thought to activate the neuronal
  differentiation of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion cells during embryonal development
  possibly through repression of Hes1 expression (Kobayashi et al. 2012). In chick
  and mouse embryos, Runx1 expression is restricted to the dorso-medial domain of
  the dorsal root ganglion, to TrkA-positive cutaneous sensory neurons. Runx3 expression
  in chick and mouse embryos is restricted to ventro-lateral domain of the dorsal
  root ganglion, to TrkC-positive proprioceptive neurons (Chen AI et al. 2006, Kramer
  et al. 2006). RUNX1 mediated regulation of neuronally expressed genes will be annotated
  when mechanistic details become available.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8878171
