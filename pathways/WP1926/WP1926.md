description: Triglycerides stored in adipocytes are hydrolyzed to yield fatty acids
  and glycerol. The glycerol is passively transported out of the adipocyte and into
  the bloodstream by Aquaporin-7 (AQP7) located in the plasma membrane of adipocytes.
  Glycerol in the bloodstream is passively transported into liver cells by AQP9 located
  in the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. Once inside the liver cell the glycerol is
  a substrate for gluconeogenesis.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=432030
