description: Integrins are a major family of cell surface receptors that modulate
  cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and survival through interaction with the
  extracellular matrix (ECM) and the actin cytoskeleton.  Integrins are type 1 transmembrane
  proteins that exist at the cell surface as heterodimers of alpha and beta subunits,
  of which there are 18 and 8 different isoforms, respectively, in human cells. In
  addition to their mechanical role in mediating contact between the ECM and the cytoskeleton,
  integrins also modulate intracellular signaling pathways governing cytoskeletal
  rearrangements and pro-survival and mitogenic signaling (reviewed in Hehlgans et
  al, 2007; Harburger and Calderwood, 2009; Ata and Antonescu, 2017). <br>In this
  pathway, we describe signaling through integrin alphaIIb beta3 as a representative
  example.<br> At the sites of vascular injury bioactive molecules such as thrombin,
  ADP, collagen, fibrinogen and thrombospondin are generated, secreted or exposed.
  These stimuli activate platelets, converting the major platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3
  from a resting state to an active conformation, in a process termed integrin priming
  or 'inside-out signalling'. Integrin activation refers to the change required to
  enhance ligand-binding activity. The activated alphaIIbbeta3 interacts with the
  fibrinogen and links platelets together in an aggregate to form a platelet plug.
  AlphaIIbbeta3 bound to fibrin generates more intracellular signals (outside-in signalling),
  causing further platelet activation and platelet-plug retraction. <br>In the resting
  state the alpha and beta tails are close together.  This interaction keeps the membrane
  proximal regions in a bent conformation that maintains alphaIIbbeta3 in a low affinity
  state. <br>Integrin alphaIIbbeta3 is released from its inactive state by interaction
  with the protein talin. Talin interacts with the beta3 cytoplasmic domain and disrupts
  the salt bridge between the alpha and beta chains. This separation in the cytoplasmic
  regions triggers the conformational change in the extracellular domain that increases
  its affinity to fibrinogen. <br>Much of talin exists in an inactive cytosolic pool,
  and the Rap1 interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) is implicated in talin activation
  and translocation to beta3 integrin cytoplasmic domain.<br>  View original pathway
