description: Simplified scheme of arylamine metabolism pathway. Arylamines are N-acetylated
  by NAT2 in the liver, transforming them to relatively nonreactive. Alternatively,
  they may be N-hydroxylated by CYPIA2, trans - ported to the bladder, and undergo
  O-acetylation by NATI, to form a highly reactive species. [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Simplified-scheme-of-arylamine-metabolism-pathway-Arylamines-are-N-acetylated-by-NAT2-in_fig2_288003735]
