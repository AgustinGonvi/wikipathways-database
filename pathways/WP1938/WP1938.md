description: tRNA synthetases catalyze the ligation of tRNAs to their cognate amino
  acids in an ATP-dependent manner. The reaction proceeds in two steps. First, amino
  acid and ATP form an aminoacyl adenylate molecule, releasing pyrophosphate. The
  aminoacyl adenylate remains associated with the synthetase enzyme where, in the
  second step it reacts with tRNA to form aminoacyl tRNA and AMP. The rapid hydrolysis
  of pyrophosphate makes these reactions essentially irreversible under physiological
  conditions (Fersht and Kaethner 1976a). Specificity of the tRNA charging reactions
  is achieved both by specific recognition of amino acid and tRNA substrates by the
  synthetase, and by an editing process in which incorrect aminoacyl adenylate molecules
  (e.g., valyl adenylate associated with isoleucyl tRNA synthetase) are hydrolyzed
  rather than conjugated to tRNAs in the second step of the reaction (Baldwin and
  Berg 1966a,b; Fersht and Kaethner 1976b). The tRNA synthetases can be divided into
  two structural classes based on conserved amino acid sequence features (Burnbaum
  and Schimmel 1991).<p>A single synthetase mediates the charging of all of the tRNA
  species specific for any one amino acid but, with three exceptions, glycine, lysine,
  and glutamine, the synthetase that catalyzes aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAs
  is encoded by a different gene than the one that acts on mitochondrial tRNAs. Both
  mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNA synthetase enzymes are encoded by genes in the
  nuclear genome.<p>A number of tRNA synthetases are known to have functions distinct
  from tRNA charging (reviewed by Park et al. 2005). Additionally, mutations in several
  of the tRNA synthetases, often affecting protein domains that are dispensable in
  vitro for aminoacyl tRNA synthesis, are associated with a diverse array of neurological
  and other diseases (Antonellis and Green 2008; Park et al. 2008). These findings
  raise interest into the role of these enzymes in human development and disease.<p>   View
