description: 'The Hedgehog proteins are a family of secreted ligands that include
  sonic hedgehog, Indian hedgehog and desert hedgehog in humans. Binding of Hedgehog
  ligands to their receptors, Patched 1 and 2, prevents inhibition of a 7 transmembrane
  receptor called Smoothened. This leads to activation of GLI family of transcription
  factors (GLI1-3). Signaling through the Hedgehog pathway is essential for development
  of many tissues and organs. This pathway is highly conserved among metazoans. Aberrant
  activation of this pathway has been associated with a number of human malignancies
  including carcinoma of lung, esophagus, pancreas and prostate.  Source: NetPath
