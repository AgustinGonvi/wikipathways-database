description: 'Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins are members of the helix-loop-helix
  (HLH) family of proteins which lack a DNA binding domain themselves but bind to
  other family members inhibiting their DNA binding capacity. This family of proteins
  is comprised of IDs 1, 2, 3 and 4. They can be stimulated by ligands such as the
  Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), TGF beta and the T cell receptor.  Source:
