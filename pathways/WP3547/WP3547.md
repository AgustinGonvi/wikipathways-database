description: Amyloid is a term used to describe deposits of fibrillar proteins, typically
  extracellular. The abnormal accumulation of amyloid, amyloidosis, is a term associated
  with tissue damage caused by amyloid deposition, seen in numerous diseases including
  neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's. Amyloid
  deposits consist predominantly of amyloid fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures
  that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross beta-sheet structure
  where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007).
  Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27
  human proteins form amyloid fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have
  non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs
  between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal
  fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial
  event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of Amyloid-beta
  assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent
  polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex,
  with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures
  in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), though it is unclear whether
  these intermediate steps are required in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests
  that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects
  of Amyloid-beta (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011)
  and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). Amyloid oligomers are believed
  to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and
  not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation
  specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of amyloid oligomer
  structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for
  the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of amyloid oligomers. Toxicity
  of amyloid oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti
  et al. 2011). <br>Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan
  sulfate proteoglycans and Serum Amyloid P-component, which are universally associated
  and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation.  View
