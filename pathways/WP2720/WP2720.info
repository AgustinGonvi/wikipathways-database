description: NOTCH1 functions as both a transmembrane receptor presented on the cell surface and as a transcriptional regulator in the nucleus.<br><br>NOTCH1 receptor presented on the plasma membrane is activated by a membrane bound ligand expressed in trans on the surface of a neighboring cell. In trans, ligand binding triggers proteolytic cleavage of NOTCH1 and results in release of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain, NICD1, into the cytosol.<br><br>NICD1 translocates to the nucleus where it associates with RBPJ (also known as CSL or CBF) and mastermind-like (MAML) proteins (MAML1, MAML2 or MAML3; possibly also MAMLD1) to form NOTCH1 coactivator complex. NOTCH1 coactivator complex activates transcription of genes that possess RBPJ binding sites in their promoters. <br><br>  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1980143 Reactome].
