Description: Vascular endothelial growth factors are crucial for the vascular development and neovascularization in physiological and pathological processes in both embryo and adult. There are three isoforms of the VEGFR receptor found. This figure shows the VEGFR3 pathway as detected in lymphatic endothelial cells. Activation of the receptor results in proliferation, survival, enhanced permeability and migration of the cell.
