description: Vascular endothelial growth factors are crucial for the vascular development
  and neovascularization in physiological and pathological processes in both embryo
  and adult. There are three isoforms of the VEGFR receptor found. This figure shows
  the VEGFR3 pathway as detected in lymphatic endothelial cells. Activation of the
  receptor results in proliferation, survival, enhanced permeability and migration
  of the cell.
