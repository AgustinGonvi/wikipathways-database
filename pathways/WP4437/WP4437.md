description: PTK6 (BRK) is an oncogenic non-receptor tyrosine kinase that functions
  downstream of ERBB2 (HER2) (Xiang et al. 2008, Peng et al. 2015) and other receptor
  tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR (Kamalati et al. 1996) and MET (Castro and Lange
  2010). Since ERBB2 forms heterodimers with EGFR and since MET can heterodimerize
  with both ERBB2 and EGFR (Tanizaki et al. 2011), it is not clear if MET and EGFR
  activate PTK6 directly or act through ERBB2. Levels of PTK6 increase under hypoxic
  conditions (Regan Anderson et al. 2013, Pires et al. 2014). The kinase activity
  of PTK6 is negatively regulated by PTPN1 phosphatase (Fan et al. 2013) and SRMS
  kinase (Fan et al. 2015), as well as the STAT3 target SOCS3 (Gao et al. 2012).<p>PTK6
  activates STAT3-mediated transcription (Ikeda et al. 2009, Ikeda et al. 2010) and
  may also activate STAT5-mediated transcription (Ikeda et al. 2011). PTK6 promotes
  cell motility and migration by regulating the activity of RHO GTPases RAC1 (Chen
  et al. 2004) and RHOA (Shen et al. 2008), and possibly by affecting motility-related
  kinesins (Lukong and Richard 2008). PTK6 crosstalks with AKT1 (Zhang et al. 2005,
  Zheng et al. 2010) and RAS signaling cascades (Shen et al. 2008, Ono et al. 2014)
  and may be involved in MAPK7 (ERK5) activation (Ostrander et al. 2007, Zheng et
  al. 2012). PTK6 enhances EGFR signaling by inhibiting EGFR down-regulation (Kang
  et al. 2010, Li et al. 2012, Kang and Lee 2013). PTK6 may also enhance signaling
  by IGF1R (Fan et al. 2013) and ERBB3 (Kamalati et al. 2000).<p>PTK6 promotes cell
  cycle progression by phosphorylating and inactivating CDK inhibitor CDKN1B (p27)
  (Patel et al. 2015).<p>PTK6 activity is upregulated in osteopontin (OPN or SPP1)-mediated
  signaling, leading to increased VEGF expression via PTK6/NF-kappaB/ATF4 signaling
  path. PTK6 may therefore play a role in VEGF-dependent tumor angiogenesis (Chakraborty
  et al. 2008).<p>PTK6 binds and phosphorylates several nuclear RNA-binding proteins,
  including SAM68 family members (KHDRSB1, KHDRSB2 and KHDRSB3) (Derry et al. 2000,
  Haegebarth et al. 2004, Lukong et al. 2005) and SFPQ (PSF) (Lukong et al. 2009).

  - In cells expressing ERBB2 and ERBB4, ligand stimulated ERBB4 can either homodimerize
    or form heterodimers with ERBB2 (Li et al. 2007), resulting in trans-autophosphorylation
    of ERBB2 and ERBB4 on C-tail tyrosine residues that will subsequently serve as
    docking sites for downstream signaling molecules, leading to activation of RAF/MAP
    kinase cascade and, in the case of ERBB4 CYT1 isoforms, PI3K-induced AKT signaling
    (Hazan et al. 1990, Cohen et al. 1996, Li et al. 2007, Kaushansky et al. 2008).
    Signaling by ERBB4 is downregulated by the action of WWP1 and ITCH ubiquitin ligases,
    and is shown under Signaling by ERBB4.

  - ERBB2 becomes activated by forming a heterodimer with another ligand-activated
    EGFR family member, either EGFR, ERBB3 or ERBB4, which is accompanied by dissociation
    of chaperoning proteins HSP90 and CDC37 (Citri et al. 2004), as well as ERBB2IP
    (Borg et al. 2000) from ERBB2. ERBB2 heterodimers function to promote cell proliferation,
    cell survival and differentiation, depending on the cellular context. ERBB2 can
    also be activated by homodimerization when it is overexpressed, in cancer for
    example. <br><br>

  - In cells expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3, ERBB3 activated by neuregulin NRG1 or NRG2
    binding (Tzahar et al. 1994) forms a heterodimer with ERBB2 (Pinkas-Kramarski
    et al. 1996, Citri et al. 2004). ERBB3 is the only EGFR family member with no
    kinase activity, and can only function in heterodimers, with ERBB2 being its preferred
    heterodimerization partner. After heterodimerization, ERBB2 phosphorylates ten
    tyrosine residues in the C-tail of ERBB3, Y1054, Y1197, Y1199, Y1222, Y1224, Y1260,
    Y1262, Y1276, Y1289 and Y1328 (Prigent et al. 1994, Pinkas-Kramarski et al. 1996,
    Vijapurkar et al. 2003, Li et al. 2007) that subsequently serve as docking sites
    for downstream signaling molecules, resulting in activation of PI3K-induced AKT
    signaling and RAF/MAP kinase cascade. Signaling by ERBB3 is downregulated by the
    action of RNF41 ubiquitin ligase, also known as NRDP1. <br><br>

  - In cells expressing both ERBB2 and EGFR, EGF stimulation of EGFR leads to formation
    of both ERBB2:EGFR heterodimers (Wada et al. 1990, Karunagaran et al. 1996) and
    EGFR homodimers. Heterodimers of ERBB2 and EGFR trans-autophosphorylate on twelve
    tyrosine residues, six in the C-tail of EGFR and six in the C-tail of ERBB2 -
    Y1023, Y1139, Y1196, Y1221, Y1222 and Y1248 (Margolis et al. 1989, Hazan et al.
    1990,Walton et  al. 1990, Helin et al. 1991, Ricci et al. 1995, Pinkas-Kramarski
    1996). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the C-tail of EGFR and ERBB2 serve
    as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Three key signaling pathways
    activated by ERBB2:EGFR heterodimers are RAF/MAP kinase cascade, PI3K-induced
    AKT signaling, and signaling by phospholipase C gamma (PLCG1). Downregulation
    of EGFR signaling is mediated by ubiquitin ligase CBL, and is shown under Signaling
    by EGFR.<br><br>
