description: Viral pathogen RNA are recognized by host helicases called RIG-I-like
  receptors (RLRs) that include DDX58 (RIG-I), DHX58 (LGP2), IFIH1 (MDA5), SNW1, and
  DDX17. These RLR proteins then go on to initiate signaling pathways, triggering
  the innate antiviral response via production of type I interferons and inflammatory
  cytokines. RLR pathway genes are characterized by rapid evolution, viral protein
  interactions, limited sets of protein domains, specific TF regulation, and densely
  connected interaction networks. The study by van der Lee et al. (2015) identfied
  novel components, DDX17 and SNW1, for the RIG-I pathway.    Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3865
