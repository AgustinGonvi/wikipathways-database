    "description": "This pathway is based on figure 7 from Read et al. When over-expressed the RIOK1 and RIOK2 proteins signal downstream of Akt to induce tumorigensis. RIOK2 also regulates signaling upstream of AKT through stimulation of the mTORC2 complex (indicated by red interactions). In the absence of RIOK1 and RIOK2 (indicated by blue interactions) the p53-dependent ribosomal stress checkpoint via RPL1 is induced. ",
