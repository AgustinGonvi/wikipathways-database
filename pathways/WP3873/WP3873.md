description: This pathway is based on figure 7 from Read et al. When over-expressed
  the RIOK1 and RIOK2 proteins signal downstream of Akt to induce tumorigensis. RIOK2
  also regulates signaling upstream of AKT through stimulation of TORC2 protein. In
  the absence of RIOK1 and RIOK2 the cell undergoes the L11 Ribosomal Stress Response
  due to reduction of AKT signaling which invokes p53 to stimulate the apoptosis cascade,
  chemosensitivity, and cell cycle arrest in the cell.
