description: 'Pathway summary from MetaCyc  General background  Oleoresin (also simply
  termed "resin" or "pitch") is a viscous secretion common in coniferous trees, which
  is involved in the chemical and physical defense of conifers against predators (such
  as beetles and fungal pathogens). The accumulated resin is released upon tissue
  injury and/or produced at the site of infestation (for review, see [Trapp01]). The
  predator is killed, encased in resin and expelled from the bore point of entry (a
  process called "pitching out"). This process has the dual function of killing and
  expelling the predator, but also to form a physical barrier around the wound through
  evaporation of the oleoresin turpentine which allows the resin acids to seal the
  wound (Croteau, 1985; Gijzen, 1993). Oleoresin is composed in roughly equal parts
  of volatile turpentine (a mixture of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) and rosin
  (also known as diterpene resin acids). The exact composition of turpentine and rosin
  varies from one conifer species to the next, as well as depending on the resin-producing
  tissue analyzed [Trapp01]. The main constituents of these fractions have been regrouped
  in the following pathways: superpathway of oleoresin turpentine biosynthesis and
  superpathway of diterpene resin acids biosynthesis.  Concerning this pathway:  Compared
  to monoterpenes, fewer sesquiterpene synthases from conifers have been identified
  and studied to date. Generally, the longer chain of (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate
  compared to that of geranyl diphosphate, and the additional double bond, allows
  for a greater diversity of products being formed by those enzymes. Two coniferous
  enzymes γ-humulene synthase and delta-selinene synthase from Grand Fir (Abies grandis)
  produces each in excess of 30 different sesquiterpenes olefins. In contrast, (E)-alpha-bisabolene
  synthase catalyzes only the synthesis of (E)-alpha-bisabolene (Bohlmann, 1998).
  Importantly, this compound has been shown to be converted by methyl-jasmonate-induced
  suspension cell cultures of Grand Fir into todomatuic acid, a sesquiterpene derivative
  structurally similar to the insect juvenile hormone III (Bohlmann, 1998), and can
  disrupt insect reproduction and/or larval development [Trapp01].  See [https://plantreactome.gramene.org/PathwayBrowser/#/R-OSA-1119328
