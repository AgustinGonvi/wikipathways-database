description: The normal sequence of contraction of atria and ventricles of the heart
  require activation of groups of cardiac cells. The mechanism must elicit rapid changes
  in heart rate and respond to changes in autonomic tone. The cardiac action potential
  controls these functions. Action potentials are generated by the movement of ions
  through transmembrane ion channels in cardiac cells. Like skeletal myocytes (and
  axons), in the resting state, a given cardiac myocyte has a negative membrane potential.
  In both muscle types, after a delay (the absolute refractory period), K+ channels
  reopen and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarisation. The voltage-gated
  Ca2+ channels on the cardiac sarcolemma membrane are generally triggered by an influx
  of Na+ during phase 0 of the action potential. Cardiac muscle cells are so tightly
  bound that when one of these cells is excited the action potential spreads to all
  of them. The standard model used to understand the cardiac action potential is the
  action potential of the ventricular myocyte (Park & Fishman 2011, Grant 2009).<br><br>The
  action potential has 5 phases (numbered 0-4). Phase 4 describes the membrane potential
  when a cell is not being stimulated. The normal resting potential in the ventricular
  myocardium is between -85 to -95 mV. The K+ gradient across the cell membrane is
  the key determinant in the normal resting potential. Phase 0 is the rapid depolarisation
  phase in which electrical stimulation of a cell opens the closed, fast Na+ channels,
  causing a large influx of Na+ creating a Na+ current (I<sub>Na+</sub>). This causes
  depolarisation of the cell. The slope of phase 0 represents the maximum rate of
  potential change and differs in contractile and pacemaker cells. Phase 1 is the
  inactivation of the fast Na+ channels. The transient net outward current causing
  the small downward deflection (the "notch" of the action potetial) is due to the
  movement of K+ and Cl- ions. In pacemaker cells, this phase is due to rapid K+ efflux
  and closure of L-type Ca2+ channels. Phase 2 is the plateau phase which is sustained
  by a balance of Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux. This phase sustains muscle contraction.
  Phase 3 of the action potential is where a concerted action of two outward delayed
  currents brings about repolarisation back down to the resting potential (Bartos
  et al. 2015).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5576891
