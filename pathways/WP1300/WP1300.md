description: '''''''Aflatoxins'''''' are naturally occurring [[wikipedia:mycotoxin|mycotoxin]]s

  After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to a reactive intermediate,
  aflatoxin M<sub>1</sub>, an [[wikipedia:epoxide|epoxide]]. Aflatoxin B1 is considered
  the most toxic and is produced by both Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus.  Source:
