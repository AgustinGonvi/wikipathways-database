Description: '''Aflatoxins''' are naturally occurring [[wikipedia:mycotoxin|mycotoxin]]s that are produced by many species of ''[[wikipedia:Aspergillus|Aspergillus]]'', a [[wikipedia:fungus|fungus]], most notably ''[[wikipedia:Aspergillus flavus|Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Aspergillus parasiticus|Aspergillus parasiticus]]''. After entering the body, aflatoxins are metabolized by the liver to a reactive intermediate, aflatoxin M<sub>1</sub>, an [[wikipedia:epoxide|epoxide]]. Aflatoxin B1 is considered the most toxic and is produced by both Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus.  Source: [[wikipedia:Aflatoxin|Wikipedia]]
