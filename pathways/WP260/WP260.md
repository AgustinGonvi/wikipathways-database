description: 'Glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose, is a storage molecule whose
  accumulation is under rigorous control in many cells. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
  glycogen biosynthesis involves three processes: nucleation, elongation, and branching
  (also known as ramification). The formation of glycogen begins when either Glg1p
  or Glg2p uses UDP-glucose to self-glucosylate to produce a short alpha (1,4)-glucosyl
  chain covalently attached to one of their internal tyrosine residues. After the
  self-glucosylation of Glg1p or Glg2p, glycogen synthase is able to extend the linear
  alpha (1,4)-glucosyl chains of glycogen by catalyzing the formation of alpha (1,4)-glucosidic
  bonds from UDP- glucose at the non-reducing ends. Branches can be added into the
  glycogen molecule by Glc3p, which is the glycogen branching enzyme (EC:2.4.1.18)
  in S. cerevisiae.'
