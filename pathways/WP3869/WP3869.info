Description: Endogenous cannabinoid receptors belong to the endocannabinoid system and are located in the mammalian brain and throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, consisting of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors. The endocannabinoid system is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Two primary endocannabinoid receptors have been identified: CNR1 and CNR2. CNR1 is found predominantly in the brain and nervous system, as well as in peripheral organs and tissues, and are the main molecular target of the endocannabinoid ligand (binding molecule), Anandamide, as well as its mimetic phytocannabinoid, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). One other main endocannabinoid is 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) which is active at both cannabinoid receptors, along with its own mimetic phytocannabinoid, CBD (cannabidiol). 2-AG and CBD are involved in the regulation of appetite, immune system functions and pain management.
