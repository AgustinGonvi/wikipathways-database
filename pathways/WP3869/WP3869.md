description: 'Endogenous cannabinoid receptors belong to the endocannabinoid system
  and are located in the mammalian brain and throughout the central and peripheral
  nervous systems, consisting of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors. The endocannabinoid
  system is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation,
  mood, and memory, and in mediating the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Two primary
  endocannabinoid receptors have been identified: CNR1 and CNR2. CNR1 is found predominantly
  in the brain and nervous system, as well as in peripheral organs and tissues, and
  are the main molecular target of the endocannabinoid ligand (binding molecule),
  Anandamide, as well as its mimetic phytocannabinoid, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).
  One other main endocannabinoid is 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) which is active
  at both cannabinoid receptors, along with its own mimetic phytocannabinoid, CBD
  (cannabidiol). 2-AG and CBD are involved in the regulation of appetite, immune system
  functions and pain management. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system   Not
  all MAPK subtypes are relevant for this pathway. The relevant types have been separately
  added on the right side of the pathway.  Source: Howlett A.C. Cannabinoid Receptor
