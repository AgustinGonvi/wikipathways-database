description: This pathway Involved in chemo-resistance of cells in bladder cancer
  begins with LOXL2 activation of CDC37 and COL2A1. COL2A1 activates the complex NRF1/2
  and two other complexes that trigger RTK/MAPK and TGFB pathways. These pathways
  along with oxidative stress promotes NRF1/2 activation of theoxidative stress pathway.
  This pathway promotes the transcription of NQO1, ECSIT, EXOC6, and SIRT1. SIRT1
  then activates SUV39H1. LOXL2 also activates some of these proteins downstream in
  the pathway (SUV39H1, EXOC6, ECSIT). This pathway has been modeled after figure
  7 in Deng et al.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the
  [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3670 CPTAC Assay Portal].
