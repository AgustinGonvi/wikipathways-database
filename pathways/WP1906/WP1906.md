  - '<b>Example Pathway: Specific Regulation of Target Genes During Notch Signaling:</b>
    <br><br>One well-studied example of cell-specific regulation of gene transcription
    is selective regulation of target genes during Notch signaling.  Notch signaling
    was first identified in Drosophila, where it has been studied in detail at the
    genetic, molecular, biochemical and cellular levels (reviewed in Justice, 2002;
    Bray, 2006; Schweisguth, 2004; Louvri, 2006).  In Drosophila, Notch signaling
    to the nucleus is thought always to be mediated by one specific DNA binding transcription
    factor, Suppressor of Hairless.  In mammals, the homologous genes are called CBF1
    (or RBPJkappa), while in worms they are called Lag-1, so that the acronym "CSL"
    has been given to this conserved transcription factor family.  There are at least
    two human CSL homologues, which are now named RBPJ and RBPJL.  <br><br>In Drosophila,
    Su(H) is known to be bifunctional, in that it represses target gene transcription
    in the absence of Notch signaling, but activates target genes during Notch signaling.  At
    least some of the mammalian CSL homologues are believed also to be bifunctional,
    and to mediate target gene repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and activation
    in the presence of Notch signaling.<br><br>Notch Co-Activator and Co-Repressor
    complexes: This repression is mediated by at least one specific co-repressor complexes
    (Co-R) bound to CSL in the absence of Notch signaling.  In Drosophila, this co-repressor
    complex consists of at least three distinct co-repressor proteins: Hairless, Groucho,
    and dCtBP (Drosophila C-terminal Binding Protein).  Hairless has been show to
    bind directly to Su(H), and Groucho and dCtBP have been shown to bind directly
    to Hairless (Barolo, 2002).  All three of the co-repressor proteins have been
    shown to be necessary for proper gene regulation during Notch signaling in vivo
    (Nagel, 2005).<br><br>In mammals, the same general pathway and mechanisms are
    observed, where CSL proteins are bifunctional DNA binding transcription factors
    (TFs), that bind to Co-Repressor complexes to mediate repression in the absence
    of Notch signaling, and bind to Co-Activator  complexes to mediate activation
    in the presence of Notch signaling.  However, in mammals, there may be multiple
    co-repressor complexes, rather than the single Hairless co-repressor complex that
    has been observed in Drosophila.  <br><br>During Notch signaling in all systems,
    the Notch transmembrane receptor is cleaved and the Notch intracellular domain
    (NICD) translocates to the nucleus, where it there functions as a specific transcription
    co-activator for CSL proteins.  In the nucleus, NICD replaces the Co-R complex
    bound to CSL, thus resulting in de-repression of  Notch target genes in the nucleus
    (Figure 2).  Once bound to CSL, NICD and CSL proteins recruit an additional co-activator
    protein, Mastermind, to form a CSL-NICD-Mam ternary co-activator (Co-A) complex.  This
    Co-R  complex was initially thought to be sufficient to mediate activation of  at
    least some Notch target genes.  However, there now is evidence that still other
    co-activators and additional DNA-binding transcription factors are required in
    at least some contexts (reviewed in Barolo, 2002).  <br><br>Thus, CSL is a good
    example of a bifunctional DNA-binding transcription factor that mediates repression
    of specific targets genes in one context, but activation of the same targets in
    another context.  This bifunctionality is mediated by the association of specific
    Co-Repressor complexes vs. specific Co-Activator complexes in different contexts,
    namely in the absence or presence of Notch signaling.'
