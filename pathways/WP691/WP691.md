description: 'Tamoxifen (TMX), sold under the brand name Nolvadex among others, is
  a medication that is used to prevent breast cancer in women and treat breast cancer
  in women and men.[1] It is also being studied for other types of cancer[1]. Tamoxifen
  is currently used for the treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor
  (ER)-positive (ER+) breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women[2]. Additionally,
  it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer.  [1]: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/tamoxifencitrate
