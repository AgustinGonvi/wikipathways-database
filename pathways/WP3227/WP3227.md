description: Human thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted
  from the anterior pituitary lobe, which plays an important physiological role in
  regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid by stimulating production and secretion
  of the thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland. TSH binds to TSH receptor which is
  a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins.
  TSH exerts its action through various signaling cascades such as cAMP cascade and
  the phospholipase C beta-mediated inositol phosphate generation. Further, it will
  give signaling to NF-kappa B, mitogen activated protein kinases, protein kinase
  C modules.    NetPath (http://www.netpath.org) is a collaborative project between
  PandeyLab at Johns Hopkins University (http://pandeylab.igm.jhmi.edu) and the Institute
  of Bioinformatics (http://www.ibioinformatics.org).  If you use this pathway, please
