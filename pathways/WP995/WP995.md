description: 'A prostaglandin is any member of a group of lipid compounds that are
  derived enzymatically from fatty acids and have important functions in the animal
  body. Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They
  are mediators and have a variety of strong physiological effects, such as regulating
  the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle tissue.[1] Prostaglandins are not
  hormones, but autocrine or paracrine, which are locally acting messenger molecules.
  They differ from hormones in that they are not produced at a discrete site but in
  many places throughout the human body. Also, their target cells are present in the
  immediate vicinity of the site of their secretion (of which there are many). The
  prostaglandins, together with the thromboxanes and prostacyclins, form the prostanoid
  class of fatty acid derivatives, a subclass of eicosanoids. Source: Wikipedia ([[wikipedia:Prostaglandin]])'
