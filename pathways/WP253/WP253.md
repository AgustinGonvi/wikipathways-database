description: 'Many yeast and bacterial species ferment pyruvate to 2,3-butanediol
  via the intermediate, acetoin.  Although acetoin is a flavorless compound, it is
  a precursor to some off-odor compounds, such as diacetyl, which can be unfavorable
  in beer and wine.  Acetoin and 2,3-butanediol are both by-products of alcoholic
  fermentation by S. cerevisiae and other wine yeasts. Acetoin production during alcoholic
  fermentation depends on the yeast strain and other variables such as substrate and
  temperature (as reported in (CITS: [16535224])). Wine yeasts with high fermentation
  power generally produce low acetoin levels and large amounts of ethanol and higher
  alcohols (alcohols with more than 2 carbons) (as reported in (CITS: [16535224])).   SOURCE:
