description: 'Valproic acid is a drug used for treatment and management of seizure
  disorders, mania and prophylactic treatment of migraine headache. In epileptics,
  valproic acid is used to control absence seizures, tonic-clonic seizures (grand
  mal), complex partial seizures, and the seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut
  syndrome.  Valproic Acid dissociates to the valproate ion in the gastrointestinal
  tract and then binds to and inhibits GABA transaminase. The drug''s anticonvulsant
  activity may be related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric
  acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by inhibiting enzymes that
  catabolize GABA or block the reuptake of GABA into glia and nerve endings. Valproic
  Acid may also work by suppressing repetitive neuronal firing through inhibition
  of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. It is also a histone deacetylase inhibitor.
  Valproic acid has also been shown to be an inhibitor of an enzyme called histone
  deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDAC1 is needed for HIV to remain in infected cells. A study
  published in August 2005 revealed that patients treated with valproic acid in addition
  to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed a 75% reduction in latent
  HIV infection.  Source: description from http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00313 Metabolic
