    "description": "The proximal tubule of the nephron reabsorbs approximately two-thirds of the Na filtered through the glomerulus. Na extrusion from the cell by the basolateral Na/K-ATPase provides the gradient for apical Na entry, and for reabsorption of  glucose, phosphate, amino acids and other component of the ultrafiltrate. This pathway organizes several of the transporters present in the proximal tubule by their function and it is based in deep-sequencing and physiological data.",
