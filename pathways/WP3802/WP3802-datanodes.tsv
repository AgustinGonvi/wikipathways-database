FasL/ CD95L
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-75157	Reactome	The Fas family of cell surface receptors initiate the apototic pathway through interaction with the external ligand, FasL.  The cytoplasmic domain of Fas interacts with a number of molecules in the transduction of the external signal to the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane. The most notable cytoplasmic domain is the Death Domain (DD) that is involved in recruiting the FAS-associating death domain-containing protein (FADD). This interaction drives downstream events.

Interleukin-1
processing	Pathway	R-HSA-448706	Reactome	The IL-1 family of cytokines that interact with the Type 1 IL-1R include IL-1Î± (IL1A), IL-1Î² (IL1B) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL1RAP). IL1RAP is synthesized with a signal peptide and secreted as a mature protein via the classical secretory pathway.  IL1A and IL1B are synthesised as cytoplasmic precursors (pro-IL1A and pro-IL1B) in activated cells. They have no signal sequence, precluding secretion via the classical ER-Golgi route (Rubartelli et al. 1990). Processing of pro-IL1B to the active form requires caspase-1 (Thornberry et al. 1992), which is itself activated by a molecular scaffold termed the inflammasome (Martinon et al. 2002). Processing and release of IL1B are thought to be closely linked, because mature IL1B is only seen inside inflammatory cells just prior to release (Brough et al. 2003). It has been reported that in monocytes a fraction of cellular IL1B is released by the regulated secretion of late endosomes and early lysosomes, and that this may represent a cellular compartment where caspase-1 processing of pro-IL1B takes place (Andrei et al. 1999). Shedding of microvesicles from the plasma membrane has also been proposed as a mechanism of secretion (MacKenzie et al. 2001). These proposals superceded previous models in which non-specific release due to cell lysis and passage through a plasma membrane pore were considered. However, there is evidence in the literature that supports all of these mechanisms and there is still controversy over how IL1B exits from cells (Brough & Rothwell 2007). A calpain-like potease has been reported to be important for the processing of  pro-IL1A, but much less is known about how IL1A is released from cells and what specific roles it plays in biology.

TRAIL  signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-75158	Reactome	Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or Apo 2 ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. This group of apoptosis induction pathways all work through protein interactions mediated by the intracellular death domain (DD), encoded within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis through its interaction with the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8/10 (Wang S & el-Deiry WS 2003; Sprick MR et al. 2002). TRAIL and its receptors, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, were shown to be rapidly endocytosed via clathrin-dependent and -independent manner in human Burkitt's lymphoma B cells (BJAB) (Kohlhaas SL et al. 2007). However, FADD and caspase-8 were able to bind TRAIL-R1/R2 in TRAIL-stimulated BJAB cells at 4<sup>o</sup>C (at which membrane trafficking is inhibited), suggesting that the endocytosis was not required for an assembly of the functional TRAIL DISC complex. Moreover, blocking of clathrin-dependent endocytosis did not interfere with the capacity of TRAIL to promote apoptosis (Kohlhaas SL et al. 2007).<br>

Regulation of
Insulin-like Growth
Factor (IGF)
transport and
uptake by
Insulin-like Growth
Factor Binding
Proteins (IGFBPs)	Pathway	R-HSA-381426	Reactome	The family of Insulin like Growth Factor Binding Proteins (IGFBPs) share 50% amino acid identity with conserved N terminal and C terminal regions responsible for binding Insulin like Growth Factors I and II (IGF I and IGF II). Most circulating IGFs are in complexes with IGFBPs, which are believed to increase the residence of IGFs in the body, modulate availability of IGFs to target receptors for IGFs, reduce insulin like effects of IGFs, and act as signaling molecules independently of IGFs.
About 75% of circulating IGFs are in 1500 220 KDa complexes with IGFBP3 and ALS. Such complexes are too large to pass the endothelial barrier. The remaining 20 25% of IGFs are bound to other IGFBPs in 40 50 KDa complexes. IGFs are released from IGF:IGFBP complexes by proteolysis of the IGFBP. IGFs become active after release, however IGFs may also have activity when still bound to some IGFBPs.
IGFBP1 is enriched in amniotic fluid and is produced in the liver under control of insulin (insulin suppresses production). IGFBP1 binding stimulates IGF function. It is unknown which if any protease degrades IGFBP1.
IGFBP2 is enriched in cerebrospinal fluid; its binding inhibits IGF function. IGFBP2 is not significantly degraded in circulation.
IGFB3, which binds most IGF in the body is enriched in follicular fluid and found in many other tissues. IGFBP 3 may be cleaved by plasmin, thrombin, Prostate specific Antigen (PSA, KLK3), Matrix Metalloprotease-1 (MMP1), and Matrix Metalloprotease-2 (MMP2). IGFBP3 also binds extracellular matrix and binding lowers its affinity for IGFs. IGFBP3 binding stimulates the effects of IGFs.
IGFBP4 acts to inhibit IGF function and is cleaved by Pregnancy associated Plasma Protein A (PAPPA) to release IGF.
IGFBP5 is enriched in bone matrix; its binding stimulates IGF function. IGFBP5 is cleaved by Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein A2 (PAPPA2), ADAM9, complement C1s from smooth muscle, and thrombin. Only the cleavage site for PAPPA2 is known.
IGFBP6 is enriched in cerebrospinal fluid. It is unknown which if any protease degrades IGFBP6.

Regulation of TP53
Activity	Pathway	R-HSA-5633007	Reactome	Protein stability and transcriptional activity of TP53 (p53) tumor suppressor are regulated by post-translational modifications that include ubiquitination, phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation and prolyl-isomerization (Kruse and Gu 2009, Meek and Anderson 2009, Santiago et al. 2013, Mantovani et al. 2015). In addition to post-translational modifications, the activity of TP53 is also regulated by binding of transcription co-factors.<p>In unstressed cells, TP53 protein levels are low due to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of TP53, which triggers proteasome-mediated degradation. In response to stress, TP53 undergoes stabilizing phosphorylation, mainly at serine residues S15 and S20. Several different kinases can phosphorylate TP53 at these sites, but the main S15 kinases are considered to be ATM and ATR, while the main S20 kinases are considered to be CHEK2 and CHEK1. Additional phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residue S46 promotes transcription of pro-apoptotic, rather than cell cycle arrest genes.<p>Acetylation mainly has a positive impact on transcriptional activity of TP53, while methylation can both positively and negatively regulate TP53.<p>Some posttranslational modifications regulate interaction of TP53 with transcriptional co-factors, some of which are themselves transcriptional targets of TP53.<p>For review of the complex network of TP53 regulation, please refer to Kruse and Gu 2009, and Meek and Anderson 2009.

Intrinsic Pathway
for Apoptosis	Pathway	R-HSA-109606	Reactome	The intrinsic (Bcl-2 inhibitable or mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis functions in response to various types of intracellular stress including growth factor withdrawal, DNA damage, unfolding stresses in the endoplasmic reticulum and death receptor stimulation. Following the reception of stress signals, proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are activated and subsequently interact with and inactivate antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. This interaction leads to the destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and release of apoptotic factors.  These factors induce the caspase proteolytic cascade, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, ultimately leading to cell death. The key players in the Intrinsic pathway are the Bcl-2 family of proteins that are critical death regulators residing immediately upstream of mitochondria. The Bcl-2 family consists of both anti- and proapoptotic members that possess conserved alpha-helices with sequence conservation clustered in BCL-2 Homology (BH) domains. Proapoptotic members are organized as follows: <p> 1. "Multidomain" BAX family proteins such as BAX, BAK etc. that display sequence conservation in their BH1-3 regions. These proteins act downstream in mitochondrial disruption. <p> 2. "BH3-only" proteins such as BID,BAD, NOXA, PUMA,BIM, and BMF have only the short BH3 motif. These act upstream in the pathway, detecting developmental death cues or intracellular damage. Anti-apoptotic members like Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and their relatives exhibit homology in all segments BH1-4. One of the critical functions of BCL-2/BCL-XL proteins is to maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane.

When entering the cell via the main path (by transferrin endocytosis), its goal is not the (still elusive) chelated iron pool in the cytosol nor the lysosomes but the mitochondria, where heme is synthesized and iron-sulfur clusters are assembled (Kurz et al,2008, Hower et al 2009, Richardson et al 2010).
