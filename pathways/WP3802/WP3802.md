description: The tumor suppressor TP53 (p53) exerts its tumor suppressive role in
  part by regulating transcription of a number of genes involved in cell death, mainly
  apoptotic cell death. The majority of apoptotic genes that are transcriptional targets
  of TP53 promote apoptosis, but there are also several TP53 target genes that inhibit
  apoptosis, providing cells with an opportunity to attempt to repair the damage and/or
  recover from stress.  <br>Pro-apoptotic transcriptional targets of TP53 involve
  TRAIL death receptors TNFRSF10A (DR4), TNFRSF10B (DR5), TNFRSF10C (DcR1) and TNFRSF10D
  (DcR2), as well as the FASL/CD95L death receptor FAS (CD95). TRAIL receptors and
  FAS induce pro-apoptotic signaling in response to external stimuli via extrinsic
  apoptosis pathway (Wu et al. 1997, Takimoto et al. 2000, Guan et al. 2001, Liu et
  al. 2004, Ruiz de Almodovar et al. 2004, Liu et al. 2005, Schilling et al. 2009,
  Wilson et al. 2013). IGFBP3 is a transcriptional target of TP53 that may serve as
  a ligand for a novel death receptor TMEM219 (Buckbinder et al. 1995, Ingermann et
  al. 2010).<p>TP53 regulates expression of a number of genes involved in the intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway, triggered by the cellular stress. Some of TP53 targets, such
  as BAX, BID, PMAIP1 (NOXA), BBC3 (PUMA) and probably BNIP3L, AIFM2, STEAP3, TRIAP1
  and TP53AIP1, regulate the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and/or cytochrome
  C release (Miyashita and Reed 1995, Oda et al. 2000, Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Nakano
  and Vousden 2001, Sax et al. 2002, Passer et al. 2003, Bergamaschi et al. 2004,
  Li et al. 2004, Fei et al. 2004, Wu et al. 2004, Park and Nakamura 2005, Patel et
  al. 2008, Wang et al. 2012, Wilson et al. 2013). Other pro-apoptotic genes, either
  involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, extrinsic apoptosis pathway or pyroptosis
  (inflammation-related cell death), which are transcriptionally regulated by TP53
  are cytosolic caspase activators, such as APAF1, PIDD1, and NLRC4, and caspases
  themselves, such as CASP1, CASP6 and CASP10 (Lin et al. 2000, Robles et al. 2001,
  Gupta et al. 2001, MacLachlan and El-Deiry 2002, Rikhof et al. 2003, Sadasivam et
  al. 2005, Brough and Rothwell 2007).<p>It is uncertain how exactly some of the pro-apoptotic
  TP53 targets, such as TP53I3 (PIG3), RABGGTA, BCL2L14, BCL6, NDRG1 and PERP contribute
  to apoptosis (Attardi et al. 2000, Guo et al. 2001, Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Contente
  et al. 2002, Ihrie et al. 2003, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Stein et al. 2004, Phan
  and Dalla-Favera 2004, Jen and Cheung 2005, Margalit et al. 2006, Zhang et al. 2007,
  Saito et al. 2009, Davies et al. 2009, Giam et al. 2012).<p>TP53 is stabilized in
  response to cellular stress by phosphorylation on at least serine residues S15 and
  S20. Since TP53 stabilization precedes the activation of cell death genes, the TP53
  tetramer phosphorylated at S15 and S20 is shown as a regulator of pro-apoptotic/pro-cell
  death genes. Some pro-apoptotic TP53 target genes, such as TP53AIP1, require additional
  phosphorylation of TP53 at serine residue S46 (Oda et al. 2000, Taira et al. 2007).
  Phosphorylation of TP53 at S46 is regulated by another TP53 pro-apoptotic target,
  TP53INP1 (Okamura et al. 2001, Tomasini et al. 2003). Additional post-translational
  modifications of TP53 may be involved in transcriptional regulation of genes presented
  in this pathway and this information will be included as evidence becomes available.<p>Activation
  of some pro-apoptotic TP53 targets, such as BAX, FAS, BBC3 (PUMA) and TP53I3 (PIG3)
  requires the presence of the complex of TP53 and an ASPP protein, either PPP1R13B
  (ASPP1) or TP53BP2 (ASPP2) (Samuels-Lev et al. 2001, Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Patel
  et al. 2008, Wilson et al. 2013), indicating how the interaction with specific co-factors
  modulates the cellular response/outcome.<p>TP53 family members TP63 and or TP73
  can also activate some of the pro-apoptotic TP53 targets, such as FAS, BAX, BBC3
  (PUMA), TP53I3 (PIG3), CASP1 and PERP (Bergamaschi et al. 2004, Jain et al. 2005,
  Ihrie et al. 2005, Patel et al. 2008, Schilling et al. 2009, Celardo et al. 2013).<p>

  - About 75% of circulating IGFs are in 1500 220 KDa complexes with IGFBP3 and ALS.
    Such complexes are too large to pass the endothelial barrier. The remaining 20
    25% of IGFs are bound to other IGFBPs in 40 50 KDa complexes. IGFs are released
    from IGF:IGFBP complexes by proteolysis of the IGFBP. IGFs become active after
    release, however IGFs may also have activity when still bound to some IGFBPs.
