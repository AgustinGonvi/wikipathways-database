description: Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter. Biochemically derived from
  tryptophan, serotonin is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract),
  blood platelets, and the central nervous system (CNS) of animals, including humans.
  It is popularly thought to be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness.
  This pathway summarizes the role of the antidepressant-sensitive serotonin (5-HT)
  transporter SERT (encoded by the SLC6A4 gene).
