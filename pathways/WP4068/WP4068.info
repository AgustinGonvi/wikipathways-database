description: The conversion of D-glucuronate to D-xylulose-5-phosphate, an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway, proceeds via L-gulonate, 3-dehydro-L-gulonate, L-xylulose, xylitol, and D-xylulose (Wamelink et al. 2008). D-glucuronate can be generated via the degradation of glucuronidated proteins. This pathway would have the effect of returning it to the pentose phosphate pathway or glycolysis.
