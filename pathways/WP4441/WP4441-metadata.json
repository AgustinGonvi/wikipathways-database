  "description": "The ERGIC (ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment, also known as vesicular-tubular clusters, VTCs) is a stable, biochemically distinct compartment located adjacent to ER exit sites (Ben-Tekaya et al, 2005; reviewed in Szul and Sztul, 2011).  The ERGIC concentrates COPII-derived cargo from the ER for further anterograde transport to the cis-Golgi and also recycles resident ER proteins back to the ER through retrograde traffic.  Both of these pathways appear to make use of microtubule-directed COPI-coated vesicles (Pepperkok et al, 1993; Presley et al, 1997; Scales et al, 1997; Stephens and Pepperkok, 2002; Stephens et al, 2000; reviewed in Lord et al, 2001; Spang et al, 2013).
