description: Vitamin D3 (VD3, cholecalciferol) is a steroid hormone that principally
  plays roles in regulating intestinal calcium absorption and in bone metabolism.
  It is obtained from the diet and produced in the skin by photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol
  and released into the bloodstream. Very few foods (eg. oily fish, mushrooms exposed
  to sunlight and cod liver oil) are natural sources of vitamin D.  A small number
  of countries in the world artificially fortify a few foods with vitamin D. The metabolites
  of vitamin D are carried in the circulation bound to a plasma protein called vitamin
  D binding protein (GC) (for review see Delanghe et al. 2015, Chun 2012). Vitamin
  D undergoes two subsequent hydroxylations to form the active form of the vitamin,
  1-alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). The first hydroxylation takes place
  in the liver followed by subsequent transport to the kidney where the second hydroxylation
  takes place. 1,25(OH)2D acts by binding to nuclear vitamin D receptors (Neme et
  al. 2017) and it has been estimated that upwards of 2000 genes are directly or indirectly
  regulated which are involved in calcium homeostasis, immune responses, cellular
  growth, differentiation and apoptosis (Hossein-nezhad et al. 2013, Hossein-nezhad
  & Holick 2013). Inactivation of 1,25(OH)2D occurs via C23/C24 oxidation catalysed
  by cytochrome CYP24A1 enzyme (Christakos et al. 2016).  View original pathway at
