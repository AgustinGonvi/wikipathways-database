description: Activated RHO GTPase RHOQ (TC10) regulates the trafficking of CFTR (cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) by binding to GOPC (Golgi-associated
  and PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein) also known as PIST, FIG or CAL.
  GOPC is a Golgi resident protein that binds several membrane proteins, thereby modulating
  their expression. In the absence of RHOQ, GOPC bound to CFTR directs CFTR for lysosomal
  degradation, while GTP-bound RHOQ directs GOPC:CFTR complex to the plasma membrane,
  thereby rescuing CFTR (Neudauer et al. 2001, Cheng et al. 2005).  View original
