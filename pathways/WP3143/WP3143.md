description: This is the second pathway out of two pathways which deals with DNA damage
  response. It has two central gene products (ATM and TP53) which are connected with
  the first DNA damage response pathway. In this pathway is only one source of DNA
  damage induction because most sources and their induction and involvement in the
  process in DNA damage are mentioned in the first DNA damage response pathway. If
  it is not mentioned different, the processes take place in the cell cytoplasm. The
  goal of this second pathway is to mention more gene products and changes in the
  cell condition through the DNA damage response pathway and at the same time to keep
  it clearly arranged
