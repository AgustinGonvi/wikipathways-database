description: WASP and WAVE proteins belong to the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein
  family, with recessive mutations in the founding member WASP being responsible for
  the X-linked recessive immunodeficieny known as the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. WASP
  proteins include WASP and WASL (N-WASP). WAVE proteins include WASF1 (WAVE1), WASF2
  (WAVE2) and WASF3 (WAVE3). WASPs and WAVEs contain a VCA domain (consisting of WH2
  and CA subdomains) at the C-terminus, responsible for binding to G-actin (WH2 subdomain)
  and the actin-associated ARP2/3 complex (CA subdomain). WASPs contain a WH1 (WASP
  homology 1) domain at the N-terminus, responsible for binding to WIPs (WASP-interacting
  proteins). A RHO GTPase binding domain (GBD) is located in the N-terminal half of
  WASPs and C-terminally located in WAVEs. RHO GTPases activate WASPs by disrupting
  the autoinhibitory interaction between the GBD and VCA domains, which allows WASPs
  to bind actin and the ARP2/3 complex and act as nucleation promoting factors in
  actin polymerization. WAVEs have the WAVE/SCAR homology domain (WHD/SHD) at the
  N-terminus, which binds ABI, NCKAP1, CYFIP2 and BRK1 to form the WAVE regulatory
  complex (WRC). Binding of the RAC1:GTP to the GBD of WAVEs most likely induces a
  conformational change in the WRC that allows activating phosphorylation of WAVEs
  by ABL1, thus enabling them to function as nucleation promoting factors in actin
  polymerization through binding G-actin and the ARP2/3 complex (Reviewed by Lane
  et al. 2014).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5663213
