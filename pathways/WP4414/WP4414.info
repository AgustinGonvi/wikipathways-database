description: Several transcription factors have been implicated in regulation of the RUNX2 gene transcription. Similar to the RUNX1 gene, the RUNX2 gene expression can be regulated from the proximal P2 promoter or the distal P1 promoter (reviewed in Li and Xiao 2007).<br>Activated estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) binds estrogen response elements (EREs) in the P2 promoter and stimulates RUNX2 transcription (Kammerer et al. 2013). Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRA) binds EREs or estrogen-related response elements (ERREs) in the P2 promoter of RUNX2. When ERRA is bound to its co-factor PPARG1CA (PGC1A), it stimulates RUNX2 transcription. When bound to its co-factor PPARG1CB (PGC1B), ERRA represses RUNX2 transcription (Kammerer et al. 2013).<br>TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, stimulates RUNX2 transcription by binding to the E1-box in the P2 promoter (Yang, Yang et al. 2011). TWIST proteins also interact with the DNA-binding domain of RUNX2 to modulate its activity during skeletogenesis (Bialek et al. 2004). Schnurri-3 (SHN3) is another protein that interacts with RUNX2 to decrease its availability in the nucleus and therefore its activity (Jones et al. 2006). In contrast, RUNX2 and SATB2 interact to enhance the expression of osteoblast-specific genes (Dobreva et al. 2006). Formation of the heterodimer with CBFB (CBF-beta) also enhances the transcriptional activity of RUNX2 (Kundu et al. 2002, Yoshida et al. 2002, Otto et al. 2002).<br>Transcription of RUNX2 from the proximal promoter is inhibited by binding of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) activated by dexamethasone (DEXA) to a glucocorticoid receptor response element (GRE), which is also present in the human promoter (Zhang et al. 2012).<br>NKX3-2 (BAPX1), required for embryonic development of the axial skeleton (Tribioli and Lufkin 1999), binds the distal (P1) promoter of the RUNX2 gene and inhibits its transcription (Lengner et al. 2005). RUNX2-P1 transcription is also autoinhibited by RUNX2-P1, which binds to RUNX2 response elements in the P1 promoter of RUNX2 (Drissi et al. 2000). In contrast, binding of RUNX2-P2 to the proximal P2 promoter autoactivates transcription of RUNX2-P2 (Ducy et al. 1999). Binding of a homeodomain transcription factor DLX5, and possibly DLX6, to the RUNX2 P1 promoter stimulates RUNX2 transcription (Robledo et al. 2002, Lee et al. 2005). The homeobox transcription factor MSX2 can bind to DLX5 sites in the promoter of RUNX2 and inhibit transcription of RUNX2-P1 (Lee et al. 2005).<br>Translocation of RUNX2 protein to the nucleus is inhibited by binding to non-activated STAT1 (Kim et al. 2003).<br>Several E3 ubiquitin ligases were shown to polyubiquitinate RUNX2, targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation: FBXW7a (Kumar et al. 2015), STUB1 (CHIP) (Li et al. 2008), SMURF1 (Zhao et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2014), WWP1 (Jones et al. 2006), and SKP2 (Thacker et al. 2016).
