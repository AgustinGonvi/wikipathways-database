description: Glyoxylate is generated in the course of glycine and hydroxyproline catabolism and can be converted to oxalate. In humans, this process takes place in the liver. Defects in two enzymes of glyoxylate metabolism, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT) and glycerate dehydrogenase/glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR), are associated with pathogenic overproduction of oxalate (Danpure 2005). The reactions that interconvert glycine, glycolate, and glyoxylate and convert glyoxylate to oxalate have been characterized in molecular detail in humans. A reaction sequence for the conversion of hydroxyproline to glyoxylate has been inferred from studies of partially purified extracts of rat and bovine liver but the enzymes involved in the corresponding human reactions have not been identified.
