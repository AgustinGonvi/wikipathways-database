description: Glyoxylate is generated in the course of glycine and hydroxyproline catabolism
  and can be converted to oxalate. In humans, this process takes place in the liver.
  Defects in two enzymes of glyoxylate metabolism, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase
  (AGXT) and glycerate dehydrogenase/glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR), are associated
  with pathogenic overproduction of oxalate (Danpure 2005). The reactions that interconvert
  glycine, glycolate, and glyoxylate and convert glyoxylate to oxalate have been characterized
  in molecular detail in humans. A reaction sequence for the conversion of hydroxyproline
  to glyoxylate has been inferred from studies of partially purified extracts of rat
  and bovine liver but the enzymes involved in the corresponding human reactions have
  not been identified.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=389661
