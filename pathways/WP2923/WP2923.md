description: '"Cell- and non-cell-autonomous regulation of immune responses in the
  intestine. The IIS pathway (blue letters and arrows) is regulated primarily by the
  insulin peptide released from the neurones. In the intestine, activity of IIS determines
  the subcellular localization of DAF-16. Whether ELT-2 and ETS-4 cooperate with DAF-16
  to regulate gene transcription remains to be determined. A separate G-protein signalling
  pathway modulates the activity of the p38 MAPK (black letters and arrows) module
  through a series of enzymes that include phospholipases, which determines the level
  of diacylglycerol (DAG), and protein kinase C (TPA-1) and protein kinase D (DFK-2).
  ATF-7 is the transcription factor that mediates p38 MAPK signalling but how it is
  co-ordinated with other transcription to orchestrated immune gene expression remains
  unclear. ZIP-2 appears to regulate immunity independently of p38 MAPK signalling.
  With the exception of FSHR-1, which functions in parallel to p38 MAPK signalling,
  the G-protein-coupled receptors that engage Goa and Gqa signalling to affect immune
  function are currently unknown."'
