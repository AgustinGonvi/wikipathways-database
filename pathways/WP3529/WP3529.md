description: Zinc is a transition metal and catalytic cofactor involved in many biological
  processes such as proliferation, development and differentiation, regulation of
  DNA synthesis, genomic stability, cell activation, RNA transcription, immune function.
  Zinc homeostasis in cells is ensured by various protein families including zinc
  transporters, zinc-binding proteins (Metallothioneins, MTs), transcription factors
  (MTF1-2). ZnT (1-10) transporters are responsible of zinc efflux and are assigned
  to the SLC30A family while ZIP (1-14) transporters are responsible for the influx
  of zinc into the cytoplasm and are assigned to the SLC39A family. Zn2+ enters into
  the cell by the ZIP transporters, and once inside the cell is available to bind
  metalloproteins (MT) which deliver to ZnT, or the zinc can bind to directly ZnTs
  and then deliver in the organelles / vesicles or lead outside the cell. Elevated
  zinc levels have been reported in different tumour tissue, such as breast and lung
  cancer
