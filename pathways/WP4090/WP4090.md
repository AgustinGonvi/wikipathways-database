description: Choline is an essential water-soluble nutrient in humans, serving as
  a precursor of phospholipids and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It is often
  associated with B vitamins based on its chemical structure but it isn't an official
  B vitamin. Its oxidation to betaine provides a link to folate-dependent, one-carbon
  metabolism where betaine is a methyl donor in the methionine cycle. Betaine is further
  metabolised to dimethylglycine which is cleared by the kidney (Ueland 2011, Hollenbeck
  2012).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6798163
