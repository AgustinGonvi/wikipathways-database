description: The MAPK cascades are central signaling pathways that regulate a wide
  variety of stimulated cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation,
  apoptosis and stress response. Therefore, dysregulation, or improper functioning
  of these cascades, is involved in the induction and progression of diseases such
  as cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and developmental abnormalities.
