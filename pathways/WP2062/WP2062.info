description: Proposed lineage fate map focusing on (1) adult tissues, (2) fetal tissues, (3) terminally differentiated cells, (5) stem cells and (4) progenitor cells. This pathway is currently in progress but will ultimately be a hub to tissue and cell type specific pathways (nodes converted to pathway nodes).   '''How to Use'''  This network is most useful when viewed in Cytoscape with corresponding cell/tissue association data. To use, simply save the GPML and open in Cytoscape (File > Import > Network (Multiple File Types)...) and change the visual style of the pathway to one of the default options under VizMapper > Current Visual Style or load this specific VisualStyle: http://altanalyze.org/TissueFateMap-VizMapperProperty.props. To visualize tissue/cell association data, load an attribute file with corresponding tissue/cell names (e.g., from AltAnalyze's TissueMapper software) using File > Import > Node Attributes (mapping the tissue column to CanonicalName) and set your coloring parameters from VizMapper > Node Color.
