description: 'N-linked glycosylation is the most important form of post-translational
  modification for proteins synthesized and folded in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (Stanley
  et al. 2009). An early study in 1999 revealed that about 50% of the proteins in
  the Swiss-Prot database at the time were N-glycosylated (Apweiler et al. 1999).
  It is now established that the majority of the proteins in the secretory pathway
  require glycosylation in order to achieve proper folding.<br>The addition of an
  N-glycan to a protein can have several roles (Shental-Bechor & Levy 2009). First,
  glycans enhance the solubility and stability of the proteins in the ER, the golgi
  and on the outside of the cell membrane, where the composition of the medium is
  strongly hydrophilic and where proteins, that are mostly hydrophobic, have difficulty
  folding properly. Second, N-glycans are used as signal molecules during the folding
  and transport process of the protein: they have the role of labels to determine
  when a protein must interact with a chaperon, be transported to the golgi, or targeted
  for degradation in case of major folding defects. Third, and most importantly, N-glycans
  on completely folded proteins are involved in a wide range of processes: they help
  determine the specificity of membrane receptors in innate immunity or in cell-to-cell
  interactions, they can change the properties of hormones and secreted proteins,
  or of the proteins in the vesicular system inside the cell.<br>All N-linked glycans
  are derived from a common 14-sugar oligosaccharide synthesized in the ER, which
  is attached co-translationally to a protein while this is being translated inside
  the reticulum. The process of the synthesis of this glycan, known as Synthesis of
  the N-glycan precursor or LLO, constitutes one of the most conserved pathways in
  eukaryotes, and has been also observed in some eubacteria. The attachment usually
  happens on an asparagine residue within the consensus sequence asparagine-X-threonine
  by an complex called oligosaccharyl transferase (OST).<br>After being attached to
  an unfolded protein, the glycan is used as a label molecule in the folding process
  (also known as Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle) (Lederkremer 2009). The majority of
  the glycoproteins in the ER require at least one glycosylated residue in order to
  achieve proper folding, even if it has been shown that a smaller portion of the
  proteins in the ER can be folded without this modification.<br>Once the glycoprotein
  has achieved proper folding, it is transported via the cis-Golgi through all the
  Golgi compartments, where the glycan is further modified according to the properties
  of the glycoprotein. This process involves relatively few enzymes but due to its
  combinatorial nature, can lead to several millions of different possible modifications.
  The exact topography of this network of reactions has not been established yet,
  representing one of the major challenges after the sequencing of the human genome
  (Hossler et al. 2006).<br>Since N-glycosylation is involved in an great number of
  different processes, from cell-cell interaction to folding control, mutations in
  one of the genes involved in glycan assembly and/or modification can lead to severe
  development problems (often affecting the central nervous system). All the diseases
  in genes involved in glycosylation are collectively known as Congenital Disorders
  of Glycosylation (CDG) (Sparks et al. 2003), and classified as CDG type I for the
  genes in the LLO synthesis pathway, and CDG type II for the others.  View original

  - About 25% of the proteome may be exported from the ER in human cells. This cargo
    is recognized and concentrated into COPII vesicles, which range in size from 60-90
    nm, and move cargo from the ER to the ERGIC. Soluble cargo in the ER lumen is
    concentrated into COPII vesicles through interaction with a receptor with the
    receptor subsequently recycled to the ER in COPI vesicles through retrograde traffic.
