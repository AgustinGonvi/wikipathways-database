description: This plant pathway represents the Calvin cycle (chloroplast). The primary
  site of CO2 fixation in C3 plants. CO2 is fixated onto ribulose-1,5-bishosphate
  to produce 3-phosphoglycerate. Part of the 3-phosphoglycerate is exported to the
  glycolysis (WP2862) while the rest is regenerated into ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.
  The process uses NADPH and ATP that have been generated by the photosynthetic electon
  transport chain (WP2861).
