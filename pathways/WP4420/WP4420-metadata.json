  "description": "This family is known as Family B (secretin-receptor family, family 2) G-protein-coupled receptors. Family B GPCRs include secretin, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptides and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors; all of which activate adenylyl cyclase and the phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium pathway (Harmar AJ, 2001).
