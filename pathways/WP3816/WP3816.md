description: Transcriptional activity of TP53 is positively regulated by acetylation
  of several of its lysine residues. BRD7 binds TP53 and promotes acetylation of TP53
  lysine residue K382 by acetyltransferase EP300 (p300). Acetylation of K382 enhances
  TP53 binding to target promoters, including CDKN1A (p21), MDM2, SERPINE1, TIGAR,
  TNFRSF10C and NDRG1 (Bensaad et al. 2010, Burrows et al. 2010. Drost et al. 2010).
  The histone acetyltransferase KAT6A, in the presence of PML, also acetylates TP53
  at K382, and, in addition, acetylates K120 of TP53. KAT6A-mediated acetylation increases
  transcriptional activation of CDKN1A by TP53 (Rokudai et al. 2013). Acetylation
  of K382 can be reversed by the action of the NuRD complex, containing the TP53-binding
  MTA2 subunit, resulting in inhibition of TP53 transcriptional activity (Luo et al.
  2000). Acetylation of lysine K120 in the DNA binding domain of TP53 by the MYST
  family acetyltransferases KAT8 (hMOF) and KAT5 (TIP60) can modulate the decision
  between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Sykes et al. 2006, Tang et al. 2006). Studies
  with acetylation-defective knock-in mutant mice indicate that lysine acetylation
  in the p53 DNA binding domain acts in part by uncoupling transactivation and transrepression
  of gene targets, while retaining ability to modulate energy metabolism and production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and influencing ferroptosis (Li et al. 2012, Jiang
  et al. 2015).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=6804758
