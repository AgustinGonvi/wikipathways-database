description: Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death which is distinct from
  apoptosis and necrosis, since cell death occurs due to failure of the glutathione-dependent
  antioxidant defenses in regulating iron. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced
  from accumulated iron and lipid peroxidation (regulated by GrX4 and 15-LO).  Ferroptosis
  is important in several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer
  cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction induced epilepsy and neurodegenerative disease.
  Ferroptosis can be induced to treat multiple forms of cancer by inhibiting tumor
  growth, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Ferroptosis has also been linked
  to neurodegenerative disease, possibly through increased inflammation caused by
  release of lipid metabolites. Description adapted from [https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa04216
  KEGG] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferroptosis Wikipedia].
