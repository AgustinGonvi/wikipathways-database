description: Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as was shown for mammals is expressed on myeloid dendritic cells, respiratory epithelium, macrophages, and appears to play a central role in mediating the antiviral and inflammatory responses of the innate immunity in combating viral infections.<p>Mammalian TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, and that triggers the receptor to induce the activation of NF-kappaB and the production of type I interferons (IFNs). dsRNA-stimulated phosphorylation of two specific TLR3 tyrosine residues (Tyr759 and Tyr858) is essential for initiating TLR3 signaling pathways.
