IKKs complex	Pathway	R-HSA-445989	Reactome	NF-kappaB is sequestered in the cytoplasm in a complex with inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkB). Almost all NF-kappaB activation pathways are mediated by IkB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates IkB resulting in dissociation of NF-kappaB from the complex. This allows translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression.

CHUK:IKBKB:IKBKG	Complex	R-HSA-168113	Reactome	Co-immunoprecipitation studies and size exclusion chromatography analysis indicate that the high molecular weight (around 700 to 900 kDa) IKK complex is composed of two kinase subunits (IKK1/CHUK/IKBKA and/or IKK2/IKBKB/IKKB) bound to a regulatory gamma subunit (IKBKG/NEMO) (Rothwarf DMet al. 1998; Krappmann D et al. 2000; Miller BS & Zandi E 2001). Variants of the IKK complex containing IKBKA or IKBKB homodimers associated with NEMO may also exist. Crystallographic and quantitative analyses of the binding interactions between N-terminal NEMO and C-terminal IKBKB fragments showed that IKBKB dimers would interact with NEMO dimers resulting in 2:2 stoichiometry (Rushe M et al. 2008). Chemical cross-linking and equilibrium sedimentation analyses of IKBKG (NEMO) suggest  a tetrameric oligomerization (dimers of dimers) (Tegethoff S et al. 2003). The tetrameric NEMO could sequester four kinase molecules, yielding an 2xIKBKA:2xIKBKB:4xNEMO stoichiometry (Tegethoff S et al. 2003). The above data suggest that the core IKK complex consists of an IKBKA:IKBKB heterodimer associated with an IKBKG dimer or higher oligomeric assemblies. However, the exact stoichiometry of the IKK complex remains unclear.

MAP kinase
activation	Pathway	R-HSA-450294	Reactome	The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, one of the most ancient and evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways, is involved in many processes of immune responses. The MAP kinases cascade transduces signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus in response to a wide range of stimuli (Chang and Karin, 2001; Johnson et al, 2002). <p>There are three major groups of MAP kinases<ul><li>the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases ERK1/2, <li>the p38 MAP kinase<li> and the c-Jun NH-terminal kinases JNK.</ul><p>ERK1 and ERK2 are activated in response to growth stimuli. Both JNKs and p38-MAPK are activated in response to a variety of cellular and environmental stresses. The MAP kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr within the  tripeptide motif Thr-Xaa-Tyr. The sequence of this tripeptide motif is different in each group of MAP kinases: ERK (Thr-Glu-Tyr); p38 (Thr-Gly-Tyr); and JNK (Thr-Pro-Tyr).<p>MAPK activation is mediated by signal transduction in the conserved three-tiered kinase cascade: MAPKKKK (MAP4K or MKKKK or MAPKKK Kinase) activates the MAPKKK. The MAPKKKs then phosphorylates a dual-specificity protein kinase MAPKK, which in turn phosphorylates the MAPK.<p>The dual specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK or MKK) differ for each group of MAPK. The ERK MAP kinases are activated by the MKK1 and MKK2; the p38 MAP kinases are activated by MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6; and the JNK pathway is activated by MKK4 and MKK7. The ability of MAP kinase kinases (MKKs, or MEKs) to recognize their cognate MAPKs is facilitated by a short docking motif (the D-site) in the MKK N-terminus, which binds to a complementary region on the MAPK. MAPKs then recognize many of their targets using the same strategy, because many MAPK substrates also contain D-sites.<p>The upstream signaling events in the TLR cascade that initiate and mediate the ERK signaling pathway remain unclear.

Regulated Necrosis	Pathway	R-HSA-5218859	Reactome	Necrosis has traditionally been considered as a passive, unregulated cell death. However, accumulating evidence suggests that necrosis, like apoptosis, can be executed by genetically controlled and highly regulated cellular process that is morphologically characterized by a loss of cell membrane integrity, intracellular organelles and/or the entire cell swelling (oncosis) (Rello S et al. 2005; Galluzzi L et al. 2007; Berghe TV et al. 2014; Ros U et al. 2020). The morphological hallmarks of the nectotic death have been associated with different forms of programmed cell death including (but not limited to) parthanatos, necroptosis, glutamate-induced oxytosis, ferroptosis, inflammasome-mediated necrosis etc. Each of them can be triggered under certain pathophysiological conditions. For example UV, ROS or alkylating agents may induce poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) hyperactivation (parthanatos), while tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or toll like receptor ligands (LPS and dsRNA) can trigger necrosome-mediated necroptosis. The initiation events, e.g., PARP1 hyperactivation, necrosome formation, activation of NADPH oxidases, in turn trigger one or several common intracellular signals such as NAD+ and ATP-depletion, enhanced Ca2+ influx, dysregulation of the redox status, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activity of phospholipases. These signals affect cellular organelles and membranes leading to osmotic swelling, massive energy depletion, lipid peroxidation and the loss of lysosomal membrane integrity. Different mechanisms of permeabilization have emerged depending on the cell death form. Pore formation by gasdermins (GSDMs) is a hallmark of pyroptosis, while mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein facilitates membrane permeabilization in necroptosis, and phospholipid peroxidation leads to membrane damage in ferroptosis. This diverse repertoire of mechanisms leading to membrane permeabilization contributes to define the specific inflammatory and immunological outcome of each type of regulated necrosis. Regulated or programmed necrosis eventually leads to cell lysis and release of cytoplasmic content into the extracellular region that is often associated with a tissue damage resulting in an intense inflammatory response.<p>The Reactome module describes necroptosis and pyroptosis.

Apoptosis	Pathway	R-HSA-109581	Reactome	Apoptosis is a distinct form of cell death that is functionally and morphologically different from necrosis. Nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic shrinking, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane blebbing characterize apoptosis in general. Mitochondria remain morphologically unchanged. In 1972 Kerr et al introduced the concept of apoptosis as a distinct form of "cell-death", and the mechanisms of various apoptotic pathways are still being revealed today. <BR>The two principal  pathways of apoptosis are (1) the Bcl-2 inhibitable or intrinsic pathway induced by various forms of stress like intracellular damage, developmental cues, and external stimuli and (2) the caspase 8/10 dependent or extrinsic pathway initiated by the engagement of death receptors<BR> The caspase 8/10 dependent or extrinsic pathway is a death receptor mediated mechanism that results in the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10. Activation of death receptors like Fas/CD95, TNFR1, and the TRAIL receptor is promoted by the TNF family of ligands including FASL (APO1L OR CD95L), TNF, LT-alpha, LT-beta, CD40L, LIGHT, RANKL, BLYS/BAFF, and APO2L/TRAIL. These ligands are released  in response to microbial infection, or as part of the cellular, humoral immunity responses during the formation of lymphoid organs, activation of dendritic cells, stimulation or survival of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic response to viral infection or oncogenic transformation. <BR> The Bcl-2 inhibitable or intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is a stress-inducible process, and acts through the activation of caspase-9 via Apaf-1 and cytochrome c. The rupture of the mitochondrial membrane, a rapid process involving some of the Bcl-2 family proteins, releases these molecules into the cytoplasm. Examples of cellular processes that may induce the intrinsic pathway in response to various damage signals include: auto reactivity in lymphocytes, cytokine deprivation, calcium flux or cellular damage by cytotoxic drugs like taxol, deprivation of nutrients like glucose and growth factors like EGF, anoikis, transactivation of target genes by tumor suppressors including p53.<BR> In many non-immune cells, death signals initiated by the extrinsic pathway are amplified by connections to the intrinsic pathway. The connecting link appears to be the truncated BID (tBID) protein a proteolytic cleavage product mediated by caspase-8 or other enzymes.
