description: GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central
  nervous system. GABA modulates neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system.
  Disruption of GABA neurotransmission leads to many neurological diseases including
  epilepsy and a general anxiety disorder. GABA is synthesized by two distinct enzymes
  GAD67 and GAD65 that differ in their cellular localization, functional properties
  and co-factor requirements. GABA synthesized by GAD65 is used for neurotransmission
  whereas GABA synthesized by GAD67 is used for processes other than neurotransmission
  such as synaptogenesis and protection against neuronal injury. GABA is loaded into
  synaptic vesicle with the help of vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter or
  VGAT. GAD65 and VGAT are functionally linked at the synaptic vesicle membrane and
  GABA synthesized by GAD65 is preferentially loaded into the synaptic vesicle over
  GABA synthesized in cytoplasm by GAD67.The GABA loaded synaptic vesicles are docked
  at the plasma membrane with the help of the SNARE complexes and primed by interplay
  between various proteins including Munc18, complexin etc. Release of GABA loaded
  synaptic vesicle is initiated by the arrival of action potential at the presynaptic
  bouton and opening of N or P/Q voltage gated Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ influx results
  in Ca2+ binding by synaptobrevin, which is a part of the SNARE complex that also
  includes SNAP25 and syntaxin, leading to synaptic vesicle fusion. Release of GABA
  in the synaptic cleft leads to binding of GABA by the GABA receptors and post ligand
  binding events.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=888590
