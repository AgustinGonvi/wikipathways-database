description: The high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway is a mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway that  regulates stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  mainly as it relates to the adaptation of yeast cells to hyperosmotic stress.  Two
  input branches activate the MAPK module by different mechanisms. The Sho1 branch
  requires Sho1p and the mucin-like proteins Hkr1p and Msb2p to sense osmostress.
  Sho1p-dependent signalling also requires small G-protein Cdc42p, and PAK family
  members Ste20 and Cla4. The target of Ste20p is the MAPKKK Ste11p, which activates
  the MAPKK Pbs2p under hyperosmotic conditions, resulting in Hog1p activation. Another
  branch, leading to the activation of Pbs2, involves a ‘two-component’ phospho-relay
  signalling system that involves transmembrane protein Sln1p and response regulator
  proteins Ypd1p and Ssk1p. In this branch, the two redundant MAPKKKs Ssk2p and Ssk22p
  participate in the phosphorylation of Pbs2p, which is responsible for the final
  activation of Hog1p. Once Hog1p is activated, it coordinates several processes necessary
  for cellular adaptation to osmotic stress, including ubiquitination, chromatin remodelling,
  the transcriptional program, mRNA export, translational response, and cell cycle
  progression. In addition to its main role in the regulation of hyperosmotic stress
  responses, the HOG pathway is also activated in response to oxidatiion, acids stress,
  organic compounds, metals, and freeze or heat stress. PMID:20641030 PMID:19878680
