description: GTP-bound active forms of RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOG, RAC1 and CDC42 bind kinectin (KTN1), a protein inserted in endoplasmic reticulum membranes that interacts with the cargo-binding site of kinesin and activates its microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity required for vesicle motility (Vignal et al. 2001, Hotta et al. 1996). The effect of RHOG activity on cellular morphology, exhibited in the formation of microtubule-dependent cellular protrusions, depends both on RHOG interaction with KTN1, as well as on the kinesin activity (Vignal et al. 2001). RHOG and KTN1 also cooperate in microtubule-dependent lysosomal transport (Vignal et al. 2001). The precise mechanism of kinectin-mediated Rho GTPase signaling cascade needs further elucidation, and only the first two steps, KTN1-activated RHO GTPase binding, and KTN1-kinesin-1 binding are annotated here.
