description: GTP-bound active forms of RHO GTPases RHOA, RHOG, RAC1 and CDC42 bind
  kinectin (KTN1), a protein inserted in endoplasmic reticulum membranes that interacts
  with the cargo-binding site of kinesin and activates its microtubule-stimulated
  ATPase activity required for vesicle motility (Vignal et al. 2001, Hotta et al.
  1996). The effect of RHOG activity on cellular morphology, exhibited in the formation
  of microtubule-dependent cellular protrusions, depends both on RHOG interaction
  with KTN1, as well as on the kinesin activity (Vignal et al. 2001). RHOG and KTN1
  also cooperate in microtubule-dependent lysosomal transport (Vignal et al. 2001).
  The precise mechanism of kinectin-mediated Rho GTPase signaling cascade needs further
  elucidation, and only the first two steps, KTN1-activated RHO GTPase binding, and
  KTN1-kinesin-1 binding are annotated here.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=5625970
