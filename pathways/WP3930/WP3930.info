Description: EDA protein regulation of hair follicle growth and differentiation through activation Nf-kB pathway occurring by binding of p65/p50 complex. The new protein complex of Nf-kB/p65/p50 activates Wnt and Bmp pathway inhibitors stopping induction/patterning. Nf-kB complex then binds with Ltb and Shh to activate pathways for growth and differentiation. This pathway is based on figure 4 from Cui et al.
