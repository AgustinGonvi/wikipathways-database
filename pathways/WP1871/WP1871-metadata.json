  "description": "Neurotransmitter is stored in the synaptic vesicle in the pre-synaptic terminal prior to its release in the synaptic cleft upon depolarization of the pre-synaptic membrane. The release of the neurotransmitter is a multi-step process that is controlled by electrical signals passing through the axons in form of action potential. Neurotransmitters include glutamate, acetylcholine, nor-epinephrine,  dopamine and seratonin. Each of the neurotransmitter cycle is independently described.
