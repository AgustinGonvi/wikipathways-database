  "description": "Type I interferons (IFNs) are composed of various genes including IFN alpha (IFNA), beta (IFNB), omega, epsilon, and kappa. In humans the IFNA genes are composed of more than 13 subfamily genes, whereas there is only one IFNB gene. The large family of IFNA/B proteins all bind to a single receptor which is composed of two distinct chains: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The IFNA/B stimulation of the IFNA receptor complex leads to the formation of two transcriptional activator complexes: IFNA-activated-factor (AAF), which is a homodimer of STAT1 and IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which comprises STAT1, STAT2 and a member of the IRF family, IRF9/P48. AAF mediates activation of the IRF-1 gene by binding to GAS (IFNG-activated site), whereas ISGF3 activates several IFN-inducible genes including IRF3 and IRF7.
