description: Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone secreted mainly by the anterior pituitary
  gland. It was originally identified by its ability to stimulate the development
  of the mammary gland and lactation, but is now known to have numerous and varied
  functions (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998). Despite this, few pathologies have been associated
  with abnormalities in prolactin receptor (PRLR) signaling, though roles in various
  forms of cancer and certain autoimmune disorders have been suggested (Goffin et
  al. 2002). A vast body of literature suggests effects of PRL in immune cells (Matera
  1996) but PRLR KO mice have unaltered immune system development and function (Bouchard
  et al. 1999). In addition to the pituitary, numerous other tissues produce PRL,
  including the decidua and myometrium, certain cells of the immune system, brain,
  skin and exocrine glands such as the mammary, sweat and lacrimal glands (Ben-Jonathan
  et al. 1996). Pituitary PRL secretion is negatively regulated by inhibitory factors
  originating from the hypothalamus, the most important of which is dopamine, acting
  through the D2 subclass of dopamine receptors present in lactotrophs (Freeman et
  al. 2000). PRL-binding sites or receptors have been identified in numerous cells
  and tissues of adult mammals. Various forms of PRLR, generated by alternative splicing,
  have been reported in several species including humans (Kelly et al. 1991, Clevenger
  et al. 2003).<br><br>PRLR is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Like
  many other members of this family, the first step in receptor activation was generally
  believed to be ligand-induced dimerization whereby one molecule of PRL bound to
  two molecules of receptor (Elkins et al. 2000). Recent reports suggest that PRLR
  pre-assembles at the plasma membrane in the absence of ligand (Gadd & Clevenger
  2006, Tallet et al. 2011), suggesting that ligand-induced activation involves conformational
  changes in preformed PRLR dimers (Broutin et al. 2010). <br><br>PRLR has no intrinsic
  kinase activity but associates (Lebrun et al. 1994, 1995) with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)
  which is activated following receptor activation (Campbell et al. 1994, Rui et al.
  1994, Carter-Su et al. 2000, Barua et al. 2009). JAK2-dependent activation of JAK1
  has also been reported (Neilson et al. 2007). It is generally accepted that activation
  of JAK2 occurs by transphosphorylation upon ligand-induced receptor activation,
  based on JAK activation by chimeric receptors in which various extracellular domains
  of cytokine or tyrosine kinase receptors were fused to the IL-2 receptor beta chain
  (see Ihle et al. 1994). This activation step involves the tyrosine phosphorylation
  of JAK2, which in turn phosphorylates PRLR on specific intracellular tyrosine residues
  leading to STAT5 recruitment and signaling, considered to be the most important
  signaling cascade for PRLR. STAT1 and STAT3 activation have also been reported (DaSilva
  et al. 1996) as have many other signaling pathways; signaling through MAP kinases
  (Shc/SOS/Grb2/Ras/Raf/MAPK) has been reported as a consequence of PRL stimuilation
  in many different cellular systems (see Bole-Feysot et al. 1998) though it is not
  clear how this signal is propagated. Other cascades non exhaustively include Src
  kinases, Focal adhesion kinase, phospholipase C gamma, PI3 kinase/Akt and Nek3 (Clevenger
  et al. 2003, Miller et al. 2007). The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is recruited
  to the C terminal tyrosine of PRLR and may have a regulatory role (Ali & Ali 2000).
  PRLR phosphotyrosines can recruit insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and other adaptor
  proteins to the receptor complex (Bole-Feysot et al. 1998).<br><br>Female homozygous
  PRLR knockout mice are completely infertile and show a lack of mammary development
  (Ormandy et al. 1997). Hemizogotes are unable to lactate following their first pregnancy
  and depending on the genetic background, this phenotype can persist through subsequent
  pregnancies (Kelly et al. 2001).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=1170546
