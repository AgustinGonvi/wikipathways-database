description: 'After undergoing rounds of translation, mRNA is normally  destroyed
  by the deadenylation-dependent pathway. Though the trigger is unclear, deadenylation
  likely proceeds in two steps: one catalyzed by the PAN2-PAN3 complex that shortens
  the poly(A) tail from about 200 adenosine residues to about 80 residues and one
  catalyzed by the CCR4-NOT complex or by the PARN enzyme that shortens the tail to
  about 10-15 residues.<br>After deadenylation the mRNA is then hydrolyzed by either
  the 5'' to 3'' pathway or the 3'' to 5'' pathway. It is unknown what determinants
  target a mRNA to one pathway or the other.<br>The 5'' to 3'' pathway is initiated
  by binding of the Lsm1-7 complex to the 3'' oligoadenylate tail followed by decapping
  by the DCP1-DCP2 complex. The 5'' to 3'' exoribonuclease XRN1 then hydrolyzes the
  remaining RNA.<br>The 3'' to 5'' pathway is initiated by the exosome complex at
  the 3'' end of the mRNA. The exosome processively hydrolyzes the mRNA from 3'' to
  5'', leaving only a capped oligoribonucleotide. The cap is then removed by the scavenging
  decapping enzyme DCPS.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=429914
