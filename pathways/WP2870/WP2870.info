Description: Protein sorting during formation of multivesicular bodies results in packaging of key molecules in exosomes. Exosomes bound-signaling ligands once released from host cells interacts with the receptors on the recipient cells to induce downstream signaling cascades pivotal in the initiation and progression of cancer. This horizontal transfer of proteomic content of exosomes can mediate signaling pathways including Wnt, PI3K and TGF-beta in recipient cells.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2870 CPTAC Assay Portal]
