  "description": "Proteins classified as transcription factors constitute a disproportionate number of SUMOylation targets. In most cases SUMOylation inhibits transcriptional activation, however in some cases such as TP53 (p53) SUMOylation can enhance activation. Inhibition of transcription by SUMOylation may be due to interference with DNA binding, re-localization to inactive nuclear bodies, or recruitment of repressive cofactors such as histone deacetylases (reviewed in Girdwood et al. 2004, Gill 2005).
