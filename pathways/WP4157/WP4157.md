description: Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter
  and a psychoactive drug. This compound is a precursor to GABA, glutamate, and glycine
  in certain brain areas, acts on the GHB receptor and is a weak agonist at the GABAB
  receptor. GHB has been used in a medical setting as a general anesthetic and as
  a treatment for cataplexy, narcolepsy, and alcoholism. It is also used illegally
  as an intoxicant, to try to increase athletic performance, and as a date rape drug.
  GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation, and is found in small quantities
  in some beers and wines, beef and small citrus fruits. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood.  Part of this
  pathway was inspired by Chapter 5 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)),
  Fig. 5.3.
