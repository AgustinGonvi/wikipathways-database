description: The transcription factor RUNX3 is a RUNX family member. All RUNX family
  members, RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3, possess a highly conserved Runt domain, involved
  in DNA binding. For a more detailed description of the structure of RUNX proteins,
  please refer to the pathway 'Transcriptional regulation by RUNX1'. Similar to RUNX1
  and RUNX2, RUNX3 forms a transcriptionally active heterodimer with CBFB (CBF-beta).
  Studies in mice have shown that RUNX3 plays a role in neurogenesis and development
  of T lymphocytes. RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor gene in various human
  malignancies.<br>During nervous system formation, the Cbfb:Runx3 complex is involved
  in development of mouse proprioceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons by regulating
  expression of Ntrk3 (Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3) and possibly
  other genes (Inoue et al. 2002, Kramer et al. 2006, Nakamura et al. 2008, Dykes
  et al. 2011, Ogihara et al. 2016). It is not yet known whether RUNX3 is involved
  in human neuronal development and neuronal disorders.<br>RUNX3 plays a major role
  in immune response. RUNX3 regulates development of T lymphocytes. In mouse hematopoietic
  stem cells, expression of Runx3 is regulated by the transcription factor TAL1 (Landry
  et al. 2008). RUNX3 promotes the CD8+ lineage fate in developing thymocytes. In
  the CD4+ thymocyte lineage in mice, the transcription factor ThPOK induces transcription
  of SOCS family members, which repress Runx3 expression (Luckey et al. 2014). RUNX3,
  along with RUNX1 and ETS1, is implicated in regulation of transcription of the CD6
  gene, encoding a lymphocyte surface receptor expressed on developing and mature
  T cells (Arman et al. 2009). RUNX3 and ThPOK regulate intestinal CD4+ T cell immunity
  in a TGF-beta and retinoic acid-dependent manner, which is important for cellular
  defense against intestinal pathogens (Reis et al. 2013). Besides T lymphocytes,
  RUNX3 is a key transcription factor in the commitment of innate lymphoid cells ILC1
  and ILC3 (Ebihara et al. 2015). RUNX3 regulates expression of CD11A and CD49D integrin
  genes, involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Dominguez-Soto et al. 2005).
  RUNX3 is involved in mouse TGF-beta-mediated dendritic cell function and its deficiency
  is linked to airway inflammation (Fainaru et al. 2004).<br>In addition to its developmental
  role, RUNX3 is implicated as a tumor suppressor. The loss of RUNX3 expression and
  function was first causally linked to the genesis and progression of human gastric
  cancer (Li et al. 2002). Expression of RUNX3 increases in human pancreatic islet
  of Langerhans cells but not in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in response to differentiation
  stimulus (serum withdrawal) (Levkovitz et al. 2010). Hypermethylation of the RUNX3
  gene is associated with an increased risk for progression of Barrett's esophagus
  to esophageal adenocarcinoma (Schulmann et al. 2005). Hypermethylation-mediated
  silencing of the RUNX3 gene expression is also frequent in granulosa cell tumors
  (Dhillon et al. 2004) and has also been reported in colon cancer (Weisenberger et
  al. 2006), breast cancer (Lau et al. 2006, Huang et al. 2012), bladder cancer (Wolff
  et al. 2008) and gastric cancer (Li et al. 2002). In colorectal cancer, RUNX3 is
  one of the five markers in a gene panel used to classify CpG island methylator phenotype
  (CIMP+) (Weisenberger et al. 2006).<br>RUNX3 and CBFB are frequently downregulated
  in gastric cancer. RUNX3 cooperates with TGF-beta to maintain homeostasis in the
  stomach and is involved in TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest of stomach epithelial
  cells. Runx3 knockout mice exhibit decreased sensitivity to TGF-beta and develop
  gastric epithelial hyperplasia (Li et al. 2002, Chi et al. 2005). RUNX3-mediated
  inhibition of binding of TEADs:YAP1 complexes to target promoters is also implicated
  in gastric cancer suppression (Qiao et al. 2016).<br>RUNX3 is a negative regulator
  of NOTCH signaling and RUNX3-mediated inhibition of NOTCH activity may play a tumor
  suppressor role in hepatocellular carcinoma (Gao et al. 2010, Nishina et al. 2011).<br>In
  addition to RUNX3 silencing through promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer (Lau
  et al. 2006), Runx3+/- mice are predisposed to breast cancer development. RUNX3
  downregulates estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) protein levels in a proteasome-dependent
  manner (Huang et al. 2012).<br>Besides its tumor suppressor role, mainly manifested
  through its negative effect on cell proliferation, RUNX3 can promote cancer cell
  invasion by stimulating expression of genes involved in metastasis, such as osteopontin
  (SPP1) (Whittle et al. 2015).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8878159
