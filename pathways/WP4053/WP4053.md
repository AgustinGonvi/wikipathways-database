description: Rab GTPases are peripheral membrane proteins involved in membrane trafficking.
  Often through their indirect interactions with coat components, motors, tethering
  factors and SNAREs, the Rab GTPases serve as multifaceted organizers of almost all
  membrane trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells. To perform these diverse processes,
  Rab GTPases interconvert between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive, GDP-bound
  form. The GTP-bound activated form mediates membrane transport through specific
  interaction with multiple effector molecules (Zerial & McBride 2001, Stenmark 2009,
  Zhen & Stenmark 2015, Cherfils & Zeghouf 2013). Conversion from the GTP- to the
  GDP-bound form occurs through GTP hydrolysis, which is not only driven by the intrinsic
  GTPase activity of the Rab protein but is also catalysed by GTPase-activating proteins
  (GAPs). GAPs not only increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis, but they are also involved
  in the inactivation of RABs, making sure they are inactivated at the correct membrane.
  Human cells contain as many as 70 Rabs and at least 51 putative Rab GAPs (Pfeffer
  2005). Only a few of these GAPs have been matched to a specific Rab substrate. The
  Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing RAB-specific GAPs (TBC/RABGAPs) are a key
  family of RAB regulators, where the TBC domain facilitates the inactivation of RABs
  by facilitating activation of GTPase activity of the RAB (Pan et al. 2006, Frasa
  et al. 2012, Stenmark 2009). Studies suggest that TBC/RABGAPs are more than just
  negative regulators of RABs and can integrate signalling between RABs and other
  small GTPases, thereby regulating numerous cellular processes like intracellular
  trafficking (Frasa et al. 2012).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8854214
