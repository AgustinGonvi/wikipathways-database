description: 'Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is triggered by high level of RAS/RAF/MAPK
  signaling that can be caused, for example, by oncogenic mutations in RAS or RAF
  proteins, or by oncogenic mutations in growth factor receptors, such as EGFR, that
  act upstream of RAS/RAF/MAPK cascade. Oncogene-induced senescence can also be triggered
  by high transcriptional activity of E2F1, E2F2 or E2F3 which can be caused, for
  example, by the loss-of-function of RB1 tumor suppressor.<br><br>Oncogenic signals
  trigger transcription of CDKN2A locus tumor suppressor genes: p16INK4A and p14ARF.
  p16INK4A and p14ARF share exons 2 and 3, but are expressed from different promoters
  and use different reading frames (Quelle et al. 1995). Therefore, while their mRNAs
  are homologous and are both translationally inhibited by miR-24 microRNA (Lal et
  al. 2008, To et al. 2012), they share no similarity at the amino acid sequence level
  and perform distinct functions in the cell. p16INK4A acts as the inhibitor of cyclin-dependent
  kinases CDK4 and CDK6 which phosphorylate and inhibit RB1 protein thereby promoting
  G1 to S transition and cell cycle progression (Serrano et al. 1993). Increased p16INK4A
  level leads to hypophosphorylation of RB1, allowing RB1 to inhibit transcription
  of E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3-target genes that are needed for cell cycle progression,
  which results in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. p14-ARF binds and destabilizes MDM2
  ubiquitin ligase (Zhang et al. 1998), responsible for ubiquitination and degradation
  of TP53 (p53) tumor suppressor protein (Wu et al. 1993, Fuchs et al. 1998, Fang
  et al. 2000). Therefore, increased p14-ARF level leads to increased level of TP53
  and increased expression of TP53 target genes, such as p21, which triggers p53-mediated
  cell cycle arrest and, depending on other factors, may also lead to p53-mediated
  apoptosis. CDKN2B locus, which encodes an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6, p15INK4B,
  is located in the vicinity of CDKN2A locus, at the chromosome band 9p21. p15INK4B,
  together with p16INK4A, contributes to senescence of human T-lymphocytes (Erickson
  et al. 1998) and mouse fibroblasts (Malumbres et al. 2000). SMAD3, activated by
  TGF-beta-1 signaling, controls senescence in the mouse multistage carcinogenesis
  model through regulation of MYC and p15INK4B gene expression (Vijayachandra et al.
  2003). TGF-beta-induced p15INK4B expression is also important for the senescence
  of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Senturk et al. 2010).<p>MAP kinases MAPK1
  (ERK2) and MAPK3 (ERK1), which are activated by RAS signaling, phosphorylate ETS1
  and ETS2 transcription factors in the nucleus (Yang et al. 1996, Seidel et al. 2002,
  Foulds et al. 2004, Nelson et al. 2010). Phosphorylated ETS1 and ETS2 are able to
  bind RAS response elements (RREs) in the CDKN2A locus and stimulate p16INK4A transcription
  (Ohtani et al. 2004). At the same time, activated ERKs (MAPK1 i.e. ERK2 and MAPK3
  i.e. ERK1) phosphorylate ERF, the repressor of ETS2 transcription, which leads to
  translocation of ERF to the cytosol and increased transcription of ETS2 (Sgouras
  et al. 1995, Le Gallic et al. 2004). ETS2 can be sequestered and inhibited by binding
  to ID1, resulting in inhibition of p16INK4A transcription (Ohtani et al. 2004).<br><br>Transcription
  of p14ARF is stimulated by binding of E2F transcription factors (E2F1, E2F2 or E2F3)
  in complex with SP1 to p14ARF promoter (Parisi et al. 2002).<br><br>Oncogenic RAS
  signaling affects mitochondrial metabolism through an unknown mechanism, leading
  to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers oxidative
  stress induced senescence pathway. In addition, increased rate of cell division
  that is one of the consequences of oncogenic signaling, leads to telomere shortening
  which acts as another senescence trigger.<br>While OIS has been studied to considerable
  detail in cultured cells, establishment of in vivo role of OIS has been difficult
  due to lack of specific biomarkers and its interconnectedness with other senescence
  pathways (Baek and Ryeom 2017, reviewed in Sharpless and Sherr 2015).   View original
