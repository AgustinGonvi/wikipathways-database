description: Two gene families are responsible for glucose transport in humans. SLC2
  (encoding GLUTs) and SLC5 (encoding SGLTs) families mediate glucose absorption in
  the small intestine, glucose reabsorption in the kidney, glucose uptake by the brain
  across the blood-brain barrier and glucose release by all cells in the body. Glucose
  is taken up from interstitial fluid by a passive, facilitative transport driven
  by the diffusion gradient of glucose (and other sugars) across the plasma membrane.
  This process is mediated by a family of Na+-independent, facilitative glucose transporters
  (GLUTs) encoded by the SLC2A gene family (Zhao & Keating 2007; Wood & Trayhurn 2003).
  There are 14 members belonging to this family (GLUT1-12, 14 and HMIT (H+/myo-inositol
  symporter)). The GLUT family can be subdivided into three subclasses (I-III) based
  on sequence similarity and characteristic sequence motifs (Joost & Thorens 2001).<p>Hexoses,
  notably fructose, glucose, and galactose, generated in the lumen of the small intestine
  by breakdown of dietary carbohydrate are taken up by enterocytes lining the microvilli
  of the small intestine and released from them into the blood. Uptake into enterocytes
  is mediated by two transporters localized on the lumenal surfaces of the cells,
  SGLT1 (glucose and galactose, together with sodium ions) and GLUT5 (fructose). GLUT2,
  localized on the basolateral surfaces of enterocytes, mediates the release of these
  hexoses into the blood (Wright et al. 2004). GLUT2 may also play a role in hexose
  uptake from the gut lumen into enterocytes when the lumenal content of monosaccharides
  is very high (Kellet & Brot-Laroche 2005) and GLUT5 mediates fructose uptake from
  the blood into cells of the body, notably hepatocytes.<p>Cells take up glucose by
  facilitated diffusion, via glucose transporters (GLUTs) associated with the plasma
  membrane, a reversible reaction. Four tissue-specific GLUT isoforms are known. Glucose
  in the cytosol is phosphorylated by tissue-specific kinases to yield glucose 6-phosphate,
  which cannot cross the plasma membrane because of its negative charge. In the liver,
  this reaction is catalyzed by glucokinase which has a low affinity for glucose (Km
  about 10 mM) but is not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate. In other tissues, this
  reaction is catalyzed by isoforms of hexokinase. Hexokinases are feedback-inhibited
  by glucose 6-phosphate and have a high affinity for glucose (Km about 0.1 mM). Liver
  cells can thus accumulate large amounts of glucose 6-phosphate but only when blood
  glucose concentrations are high, while most other tissues can take up glucose even
  when blood glucose concentrations are low but cannot accumulate much intracellular
  glucose 6-phosphate. These differences are consistent with the view that that the
  liver functions to buffer blood glucose concentrations, while most other tissues
  take up glucose to meet immediate metabolic needs.<p>Glucose 6-phosphatase, expressed
  in liver and kidney, allows glucose 6-phosphate generated by gluconeogenesis (both
  tissues) and glycogen breakdown (liver) to leave the cell. The absence of glucose
  6-phosphatase from other tissues makes glucose uptake by these tissues essentially
  irreversible, consistent with the view that cells in these tissues take up glucose
  for local metabolic use.<p>Class II facilitative transporters consist of GLUT5,
