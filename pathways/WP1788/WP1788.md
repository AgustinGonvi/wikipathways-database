description: In a healthy adult human, about 500 mg of cholesterol is converted to
  bile salts daily. Newly synthesized bile salts are secreted into the bile and released
  into the small intestine where they emulsify dietary fats (Russell 2003). About
  95% of the bile salts in the intestine are recovered and returned to the liver (Kullak-Ublick
  et al. 2004; Trauner and Boyer 2002). The major pathway for bile salt synthesis
  in the liver begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol.
  Bile salt synthesis can also begin with the synthesis of an oxysterol - 24-hydroxycholesterol
  or 27-hydroxycholesterol. In the body, the initial steps of these two pathways occur
  in extrahepatic tissues, generating intermediates that are transported to the liver
  and converted to bile salts via the 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol pathway. These extrahepatic
  pathways contribute little to the total synthesis of bile salts, but are thought
  to play important roles in extrahepatic cholesterol homeostasis (Javitt 2002).  View
