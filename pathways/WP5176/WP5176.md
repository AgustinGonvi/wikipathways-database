description: This pathway model displays disorders of bile acid synthesis and biliary
  transport. There are 13 included disorders, of which 8 are enzyme deficiencies,
  and 5 are related to transporters. The enzyme deficiencies include 3β-Dehydrogenase
  deficiency, 5β-Reductase deficiency, Spastic Paraplegia 5A, Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  deficiency, Sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency, α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR)
  deficiency, Bile acid amidation defect, and Bile acid-CoA ligase deficiency (BA
  CoA LD). Disorders of transporters are related to deficiencies in ATP8B1 (Progressive
  familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1; PFIC1), ABCB11 (Progressive familial intrahepatic
  cholestasis type 2; PFIC 2), ABCB4 (Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis
  type 3), and ABCC2 (Dubin-Johnson syndrome), as well as OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 disease
  (Rotor Syndrome). This pathway is based on Chapter 34 of Blau’s ‘Physicians Guide
  to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (ISBN
  3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
