description: 'There are 4 Notch receptors in humans (Notch 1-4) that bind to a family
  of 5 ligands (Jagged 1 and 2 and Delta-like 1-3). The Notch receptors are expressed
  on the cell surface as heterodimeric proteins and their ligands are also membrane-bound.
  Signaling through the Notch receptors is triggered by ligand-binding that induces
  cleavage of the extracellular domain by an ADAM family metalloprotease followed
  by a cleavage within the transmembrane domain by gamma secretase complex. The second
  cleavage leads to translocation of the cytosolic domain of Notch receptors into
  the nucleus. Notch proteins are important in lineage specification and stem cell
  maintenance. Aberrant Notch signaling has been linked to a number of malignancies
  including leukemias, lymphomas and carcinomas of the breast, skin, lung, cervix
  and kidneys.  Source: NetPath http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_3'
