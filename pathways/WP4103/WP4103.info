description: Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is an inflammatory disease of the stomach and small intestine caused by infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. Signs and symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, lack of energy, and dehydration. Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limiting disease that does not require medication but the preferred method of treatment is oral rehydration therapy. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis worldwide (Kopic & Geibel 2010, Gonzales-Siles & Sjoling 2016).
