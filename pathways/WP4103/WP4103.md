description: Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is an inflammatory
  disease of the stomach and small intestine caused by infections by viruses, bacteria,
  parasites and fungi. Signs and symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
  fever, lack of energy, and dehydration. Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and
  self-limiting disease that does not require medication but the preferred method
  of treatment is oral rehydration therapy. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)
  is one of the leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis worldwide (Kopic & Geibel
  2010, Gonzales-Siles & Sjoling 2016).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8942233
