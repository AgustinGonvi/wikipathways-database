description: Synapse formation and maturation require multiple interactions between
  presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. These interactions are mediated by a diverse
  set of synaptogenic proteins (Kegel et al. 2013, Siddiqui & Craig 2011). Initial
  synapse formation needs both the binding of secreted proteins to presynaptic and
  postsynaptic receptors, and the direct binding between presynaptic and postsynaptic
  transmembrane proteins. One class of molecules that plays an important role in cellular
  interactions in nervous system development and function is the leucine-rich glioma
  inactivated (LGI) protein family. These are secreted synaptogenic proteins consisting
  of an LRR (leucine-rich repeat) domain and a epilepsy-associated or EPTP (epitempin)
  domain (Gu et al. 2002). Both protein domains are generally involved in protein-protein
  interactions. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the mechanism of action
  of LGI proteins involves binding to a subset of cell surface receptors belonging
  to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, i.e. ADAM11, ADAM22 and
  ADAM23. These interactions play crucial role in the development and function of
  the vertebrate nervous system mainly mediating synaptic transmission and myelination
  (Kegel et al. 2013, Novak 2004, Seals & Courtneidge 2003).  View original pathway
