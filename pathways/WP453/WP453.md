description: 'Inflammation is a protective response of cells to pathogens, infection
  or tissue damage. It involves the coordinated communication of different immune
  cells and blood vessels through an intricate cascade of molecular signals. Inflammation
  can cause fever, cardiovascular pathology, allergy anaphylaxis, fibrosis, autoimmunity,
  etc.  The inflammatory response has four phases: inflammatory inducers (infection
  or tissue damage), inflammatory sensors (mast cells and macrophages), inflammatory
  mediators (cytokines, chemokines, etc.) and the tissues that are affected. Each
  phase has many options that are triggered based on the type pathogen introduced.  In
  addition, chronic inflammatory conditions, where an inducer is not well defined,
  are becoming more common. These conditions are of particular interest because they
  coincide with other diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis,
  neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. [http://www.thermofisher.com/ls/en/home/life-science/cell-analysis/signaling-pathways/inflammatory-response-pathway.html#]  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP453
