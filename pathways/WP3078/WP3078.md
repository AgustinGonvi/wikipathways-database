description: This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has been
  demonstrated in another species. The inference is based on Ensembl Compara orthology
  projection. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities (in input,
  output and catalyst) have a mapped ortholog or paralog are inferred to the other
  species. High-level events are also inferred for these events to allow for easier
  navigation.  Details of projection methods and parameters may be found at [http://plantreactome.gramene.org/
  Plant Reactome].  Source:[http://plantreactome.gramene.org/ Plant Reactome].
