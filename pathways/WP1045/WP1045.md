description: 'The signal transduction mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological
  activities of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) have been extensively studied
  since its discovery nearly 30 years ago. TGF-β ligands belong to a large superfamily
  of cytokines that bears its name (TGF-β Superfamily) and includes bone morphogenic
  proteins, activins, inhibin, growth/differentiation factors, Mullerian inhibiting
  substance, Nodal, and several other structurally-related polypeptides. Mammals express
  three TGF-β isoforms (i.e., TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3) that are encoded by distinct
  genes in a tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated manner. TGF-β was identified
  originally via its stimulation of morphological transformation and anchorage-independent
  growth in fibroblasts; however, this cytokine is now recognized as being a potent
  tumor suppressor that prevents the dysregulated growth and survival of epithelial,
  endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. In addition, numerous studies have clearly
  established TGF-β as a multifunctional cytokine that plays essential roles in regulating
  virtually all aspects of mammalian development and differentiation, and in maintaining
  mammalian tissue homeostasis. The pleiotropic nature of TGF-β is highlighted by
  the fact that every cell in the metazoan body can produce and respond to this cytokine.
  Even more remarkably, malignant cells have evolved a variety of complex mechanisms
  capable of circumventing the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-β, and in doing
  so, typically convert the functions of TGF-β to that of a tumor promoter, particularly
  the induction of carcinoma epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and dissemination
  to distant organ sites. This peculiar conversion in TGF-β function is known as the
  "TGF-β Paradox", which underlies the lethality of TGF-β in metastatic cancer cells.
  Thus, elucidating the effectors and signaling modules activated by TGF-β may offer
  new insights into the development of novel neoadjuvants capable of effectively targeting
  the TGF-β pathway to significantly improve the clinical course of patients with
  cancer, fibrosis, or immunologic disorders. TGF-β is secreted from cells as a latent
  homodimeric polypeptide that becomes tethered to the extracellular matrix by latent-TGF-β-binding
  proteins. Mature TGF-β isoforms are activated and liberated from extracellular matrix
  depots by a variety of mechanisms, including proteolysis, reactive oxygen species,
  changes in pH, and physical interactions with integrins, thromobspondin-1, or SPARC.
  Once activated, mature TGF-β initiates transmembrane signaling by binding to two
  distinct transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinases, termed TGF-β type I (TβR-I) and
  type II (TβR-II) receptors. In some cells and tissues, TGF-β also binds to a third
  cell surface receptor, TGF-β type III (TβR-III), which transfers TGF-β to TβR-II
  and TβR-I. Full activation of these cytokine:receptor ternary complexes transpires
  upon TβR-II-mediated transphosphorylation and activation of TβR-I, which then phosphorylates
  and activates the latent transcription factors, Smad2 and Smad3. Afterward, phosphorylated
  Smad2/3 interact physically with Smad4, with the resulting heterotrimers translocating
  into the nucleus to regulate the expression of TGF-β-responsive genes. These Smad-dependent
  events are subject to fine-tuning and crosstalk regulation in the cytoplasm by their
  interaction with a variety of adapter molecules, including SARA, Hgs, PML and Dab2,
  and with Smad7, whose inhibitory activity is modulated by STRAP, AMSH2, and Arkadia;
  and in the nucleus by their interaction with a variety of transcriptional activators
  and repressors that occur in a gene- and cell-specific manner. In addition to activating
  canonical Smad2/3-dependent signaling, accumulating evidence clearly links the development
  of a variety of human pathologies to aberrant coupling of TGF-β to its noncanonical
  effector molecules. Included in this ever expanding list of noncanonical signaling
  molecules stimulated by TGF-β are PI3K, AKT, mTOR, integrins and focal adhesion
  kinase, and members of the MAP kinase (e.g., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK small GTP-binding
  proteins (e.g., Ras, Rho, and Rac1). The interactions and intersections between
  canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.    Please
