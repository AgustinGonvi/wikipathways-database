Description: The signal transduction mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological activities of transforming growth factor-� (TGF-�) have been extensively studied since its discovery nearly 30 years ago. TGF-� ligands belong to a large superfamily of cytokines that bears its name (TGF-� Superfamily) and includes bone morphogenic proteins, activins, inhibin, growth/differentiation factors, Mullerian inhibiting substance, Nodal, and several other structurally-related polypeptides. Mammals express three TGF-� isoforms (i.e., TGF-�1, TGF-�2, and TGF-�3) that are encoded by distinct genes in a tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated manner. TGF-� was identified originally via its stimulation of morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth in fibroblasts; however, this cytokine is now recognized as being a potent tumor suppressor that prevents the dysregulated growth and survival of epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells. In addition, numerous studies have clearly established TGF-� as a multifunctional cytokine that plays essential roles in regulating virtually all aspects of mammalian development and differentiation, and in maintaining mammalian tissue homeostasis. The pleiotropic nature of TGF-� is highlighted by the fact that every cell in the metazoan body can produce and respond to this cytokine. Even more remarkably, malignant cells have evolved a variety of complex mechanisms capable of circumventing the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-�, and in doing so, typically convert the functions of TGF-� to that of a tumor promoter, particularly the induction of carcinoma epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and dissemination to distant organ sites. This peculiar conversion in TGF-� function is known as the "TGF-� Paradox", which underlies the lethality of TGF-� in metastatic cancer cells. Thus, elucidating the effectors and signaling modules activated by TGF-� may offer new insights into the development of novel neoadjuvants capable of effectively targeting the TGF-� pathway to significantly improve the clinical course of patients with cancer, fibrosis, or immunologic disorders. TGF-� is secreted from cells as a latent homodimeric polypeptide that becomes tethered to the extracellular matrix by latent-TGF-�-binding proteins. Mature TGF-� isoforms are activated and liberated from extracellular matrix depots by a variety of mechanisms, including proteolysis, reactive oxygen species, changes in pH, and physical interactions with integrins, thromobspondin-1, or SPARC. Once activated, mature TGF-� initiates transmembrane signaling by binding to two distinct transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinases, termed TGF-� type I (T�R-I) and type II (T�R-II) receptors. In some cells and tissues, TGF-� also binds to a third cell surface receptor, TGF-� type III (T�R-III), which transfers TGF-� to T�R-II and T�R-I. Full activation of these cytokine:receptor ternary complexes transpires upon T�R-II-mediated transphosphorylation and activation of T�R-I, which then phosphorylates and activates the latent transcription factors, Smad2 and Smad3. Afterward, phosphorylated Smad2/3 interact physically with Smad4, with the resulting heterotrimers translocating into the nucleus to regulate the expression of TGF-�-responsive genes. These Smad-dependent events are subject to fine-tuning and crosstalk regulation in the cytoplasm by their interaction with a variety of adapter molecules, including SARA, Hgs, PML and Dab2, and with Smad7, whose inhibitory activity is modulated by STRAP, AMSH2, and Arkadia; and in the nucleus by their interaction with a variety of transcriptional activators and repressors that occur in a gene- and cell-specific manner. In addition to activating canonical Smad2/3-dependent signaling, accumulating evidence clearly links the development of a variety of human pathologies to aberrant coupling of TGF-� to its noncanonical effector molecules. Included in this ever expanding list of noncanonical signaling molecules stimulated by TGF-� are PI3K, AKT, mTOR, integrins and focal adhesion kinase, and members of the MAP kinase (e.g., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK small GTP-binding proteins (e.g., Ras, Rho, and Rac1). The interactions and intersections between canonical and noncanonical TGF-� signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.
