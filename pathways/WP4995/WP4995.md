description: The VENTX (also known as VENT homeobox or VENTX2) gene is a member of
  the homeobox family of transcription factors. The ortholog of VENTX was first described
  in Xenopus where it participates in BMP and Nanog signaling pathways and controls
  dorsoventral mesoderm patterning (Onichtchouk et al. 1996, Scerbo et al. 2012).
  The zebrafish ortholog of VENTX is also involved in dorsoventral patterning in the
  early embryo (Imai et al. 2001). Rodents lack the VENTX ortholog (Zhong and Holland
  2011). VENTX is expressed in human blood cells (Moretti et al. 2001) and appears
  to play an important role in hematopoiesis. The role of VENTX in hematopoiesis was
  first suggested based on its role in mesoderm patterning in Xenopus and zebrafish
  (Davidson and Zon 2000). VENTX promotes cell cycle arrest and differentiation of
  hematopoietic stem cells and/or progenitor cells (Wu, Gao, Ke, Giese and Zhu 2011,
  Wu et al. 2014). Ventx suppression leads to expansion of hematopoietic stem cells
  and multi-progenitor cells (Gao et, J. Biol.Chem, 2012). VENTX induces transcription
  of cell cycle inhibitors TP53 (p53) and p16INK4A  and activates tumor suppressor
  pathways regulated by TP53 and p16INK4A (Wu, Gao, Ke, Hager et al. 2011), as well
  as macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R) (Wu, Gao, Ke, Giese and
  Zhu 2011) and inhibits transcription of cyclin D1 (CCND1) (Gao et al. 2010) and
  Interleukin-6 (IL6) (Wu et al. 2014). Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that
  EGR3 transcription factor directly binds to the promoter of IL6 and IL8 genes (Baron
  VT et al, BJC 2015). While VENTX expression may suppress lymphocytic leukemia (Gao
  et al. 2010), high levels of VENTX have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia
  cells, with a positive effect on their proliferation (Rawat et al. 2010). Another
  homeobox transcription factor that regulates differentiation of hematopoietic stemm
  cells is DLX4 (Bon et al. 2015). Studies on colon cancer showed that VentX regulates
  tumor associated macrophages and reverts immune suppression in tumor microenvironment
  (Le et al. 2018). MEK1 is required for Xenopus Ventx2 asymmetric distribution during
  blastula cell division. Ventx2 inhibition by MEK1 is required for embryonic cell
  commitment (Scerbo et al, eLife, 2017). VENTX induces TP53-independent apoptosis
  in cancer cells (Gao H, Oncotarget, 2016). During  Xenopus embryonic development,
  VENTX ortholog regulates transcription of the sox3 gene (Rogers et al. 2007) as
  well as the early neuronal gene zic3 (Umair et al. 2018).  View original pathway
