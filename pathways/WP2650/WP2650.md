description: Eicosanoids, oxygenated, 20-carbon fatty acids, are autocrine and paracrine
  signaling molecules that modulate physiological processes including pain, fever,
  inflammation, blood clot formation, smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, and
  the release of gastric acid. Eicosanoids are  synthesized in humans primarily from
  arachidonic acid (all-cis 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) that is released from
  membrane phospholipids. Once released, arachidonic acid is acted on by prostaglandin
  G/H synthases (PTGS, also known as cyclooxygenases (COX)) to form prostaglandins
  and thromboxanes, by arachidonate lipoxygenases (ALOX) to form leukotrienes, epoxygenases
  (cytochrome P450s and epoxide hydrolase) to form epoxides such as 15-eicosatetraenoic
  acids, and omega-hydrolases (cytochrome P450s) to form hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids
  (Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance 2008).<br>Levels of free arachidonic acid
  in the cell are normally very low so the rate of synthesis of eicosanoids is determined
  primarily by the activity of phospholipase A2, which mediates phospholipid cleavage
  to generate free arachidonic acid. The enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism
  are typically constitutively expressed so the subset of these enzymes expressed
  by a cell determines the range of eicosanoids it can synthesize.<br>Eicosanoids
  are unstable, undergoing conversion to inactive forms with half-times under physiological
  conditions of seconds or minutes. Many of these reactions appear to be spontaneous.  View
