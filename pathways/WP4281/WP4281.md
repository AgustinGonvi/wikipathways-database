description: 'Cholesterol is an animal sterol that can be found in its free or storage
  form in plasma, or within body tissues such as the liver, spinal cord and brain.
  (1) The storage form of cholesterol, known as cholesteryl ester, is formed through
  an ester bond between a fatty acid carboxylate group and the hydroxyl group of cholesterol.
  (1)   Cholesterol is essential for the maintenance of stability within animal cell
  membranes and acts as a precursor for the biosynthesis of Vitamin D and bile acids.
  (3) It is also necessary for the synthesis of pregnenolone, which in turn, is a
  precursor for all steroid hormones- including glucocorticoids, estrogens, progesterones,  androgens
  and aldosterone. (3) Another key role of cholesterol is within neuronal physiology;
  it is essential for synapse and dendrite development, and forms a major component
  of myelin. (4)            Biosynthesis and regulation   Given the essentiality of
  cholesterol in the body, all cells are capable of its biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA
  via a complex, multistep process occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic
  compartments. (1) Generally, over half the cholesterol in the body (approximately
  700 mg/d) arises thorough this endogenous biosynthesis, with 20% of this cholesterol
  being synthesised in the liver and intestine. (1) The remainder is sourced from
  the consumption of animal-derived foods in the diet. (1) Regulation cholesterol
  biosynthesis relies on cholesterol levels within the cell. (6)  Maintaining cellular
  lipid homeostasis is critical for cell survival and homeostatic disturbances may
  lead to disease. (7)  - Membrane bound transcription factors SREBPs (sterol regulatory
  element binding proteins) regulate de novo cholesterol synthesis. Two genes in the
  human genome encode 3 SREBP isoforms: SREBP-1a, SREBP 1c/ADD1 and SREBP-2. (6) Activation
  of SREBPs and thus the biosynthesis of cholesterol is mediated by SCAP (SREBP cleavage
  activating protein), which acts as a cholesterol sensor in the cell. (6)   - In
  cholesterol-replete cells, SREBP is bound to SCAP, forming the SREBP-SCAP complex.
  (6) The complex is bound to Insig, a resident protein on the endoplasmic reticulum
  whose expression is induced by insulin. (6) Through this sequestration of the SREBP-SCAP
  complex to the endoplasmic reticulum, cholesterol biosynthesis is inhibited. (6)  -
  When SCAP senses depleted cholesterol levels within the cell, the SCAP-SREBP complex
  dissociates from Insig, and moves towards the Golgi apparatus. (6) Two proteolytic
  cleavage events, mediated by site 1 (S1P) and site 2 (S2P) proteases that are activated
  by SCAP in low-cholesterol environments, enable the the release of SREBP from the
  membrane. (6)  - Released SREBP travels to the nucleus and binds to sterol regulatory
  element (SRE) sequences in target gene promotor regions to stimulate their transcription.
  (6) Target genes include low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase.
  (6) The former plays a key role in scavenging low-density lipoproteins (primary
  cholesterol carriers) in the blood, while the latter is necessary for endogenous
  cholesterol synthesis. (6) At the synthesis level, HMG-CoA may also inhibit cholesterol
  production if the sterol-sensing domain of the enzyme detects cholesterol levels
  to be high. (6) This is mediated by the sterol-regulated binding of HMG-CoA to Insig,
  which promotes the enzyme''s ubiquitylation and proteosomal degredation. (6)            Transport   Cholesterol,
  predominately in its esterified form, is transported between tissues in lipoproteins.
  (1) Lipoproteins facilitate the transport of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters
  via emulsification; i.e. the spherical lipoprotein unit contains a nonpolar core
  of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, surrounded by an amphiphathic layer of
  phospholipids, apoproteins and small amounts of non-esterified cholesterol. (7)   Different
  types of lipoproteins are classified according to their increasing levels of density.
  (botham) These include chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate
  density lipoprotein (IDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein
  (HDL). (7) One or more apolipoproteins (known as Apo A, Apo B, Apo C etc.) are present
  in each lipoprotein, and contribute to the differentiation, structure and enzymatic
  activity of the various lipoproteins. (botham) Apolipoproteins also act as ligands
  for the binding of lipoproteins to tissue lipoprotein receptors, which facilitates
  the uptake of lipids by cells. (1)  Dietary cholesterol and other lipids, including
  free fatty acids and triglycerides, are packaged in chylomicrons for transport out
  of the intestine. (7) Ultimately, triglycerides are transferred to muscle and adipose
  tissue, and this is followed by the transfer of cholesterol to the liver via chylomicron
  remnants. (7) Chylomicron remnants, high in cholesteryl esters, are formed following
  the removal of the lipoproteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s triglyceride core. (7) The uptake of chylomicron
  remnants by the liver is facilitated by the binding of Apo E to specific receptors
  located only on hepatic cells. (7) In the liver, chylomicron remnants are catabolised
  by lysosomes, leading to the liberation of cholesterol; this cholesterol may either
  be excreted from the body via bile acids, or incorporated into VLDL for transport
  alongside biosynthesised cholesterol to peripheral tissues. (7) In the circulation,
  VLDL is eventually converted into remnant VLDL particles, then into LDL particles,
  which are cholesterol rich and contain approximately 75% of all plasma cholesterol.
  (7) It is LDL particles that ultimately bind to specific LDL tissue receptors to
  provide a supply of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. (6) Such tissues include
  the adrenal glands, skeletal muscle, lymphocytes, gonads and kidneys. (6)'
