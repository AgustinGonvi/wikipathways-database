description: This pathway is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids)
  [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php]. Omega-3 and omega-6 FAs (Fatty
  acids) are important fats obtained from diet, and are both polyunsaturated (indicating
  many double bonds in the lipid tail).The position of the double bond is given in
  the name of the lipid, for example 22:2(13Z,16Z) means a tail length of 22 carbons,
  with 2 double bond. One double bond is at the 13 Carbon, the second on the 16th.This
  number is counted from the tail end of the lipid chain (indicating that the example
  lipid is a 22 - 16 = omega-6 FA).
