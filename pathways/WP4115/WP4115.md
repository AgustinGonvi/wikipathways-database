description: Post-mitotic neurons do not have an active cell cycle. However, deregulation
  of Cyclin Dependent Kinase-5 (CDK5) activity in these neurons can aberrantly activate
  various components of cell cycle leading to neuronal death (Chang et al. 2012).
  Random activation of cell cycle proteins has been shown to play a key role in the
  pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders (Yang et al. 2003, Lopes et
  al. 2009). CDK5 is not activated by the canonical cyclins, but binds to its own
  specific partners, CDK5R1 and CDK5R2 (aka p35 and p39, respectively) (Tsai et al.
  1994, Tang et al. 1995). Expression of p35 is nearly ubiquitous, whereas p39 is
  largely expressed in the central nervous system. A variety of neurotoxic insults
  such as beta-amyloid (A-beta), ischemia, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress disrupt
  the intracellular calcium homeostasis in neurons, thereby leading to the activation
  of calpain, which cleaves p35 into p25 and p10 (Lee et al. 2000). p25 has a six-fold
  longer half-life compared to p35 and lacks the membrane anchoring signal, which
  results in its constitutive activation and mislocalization of the CDK5:p25 complex
  to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. There, CDK5:p25 is able to access and phosphorylate
  a variety of atypical targets, triggering a cascade of neurotoxic pathways that
  culminate in neuronal death. One such neurotoxic pathway involves CDK5-mediated
  random activation of cell cycle proteins which culminate in neuronal death. Exposure
  of primary cortical neurons to oligomeric beta-amyloid (1-42) hyper-activates CDK5
  due to p25 formation, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C. CDK5
  phosphorylates CDC25A at S40, S116 and S261; CDC25B at S50, T69, S160, S321 and
  S470; and CDC25C at T48, T67, S122, T130, S168 and S214. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation
  of CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C not only increases their phosphatase activities but
  also facilitates their release from 14-3-3 inhibitory binding. CDC25A, CDC25B and
  CDC25C in turn activate CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4 kinases causing neuronal death. Consistent
  with this mechanism, higher CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C activities were observed in
  human Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical samples, as compared to age-matched controls.
  Inhibition of CDC25 isoforms confers neuroprotection to beta-amyloid toxicity, which
  underscores the contribution of this pathway to AD pathogenesis  View original pathway
