p-8Y-FGFR1b 	Protein	P11362-19	Uniprot-TrEMBL	While the existence of a "b" isoform of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 is well established and its biochemical and functional properties have been extensively characterized (e.g., Mohammadi et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2006), its amino acid sequence is not represented in reference protein sequence databases, except as the 47-residue polypeptide (deposited in GenBank as accession AAB19502) first used by Johnson et al. (1991) to distinguish the "b" and "c" isoforms of the receptor.

Other interleukin
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-449836	Reactome	Interleukins are low molecular weight proteins that bind to cell surface receptors and act in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion. They were first identified as factors produced by leukocytes but are now known to be produced by many other cells throughout the body. They have pleiotropic effects on cells which bind them, impacting processes such as tissue growth and repair, hematopoietic homeostasis, and multiple levels of the host defense against pathogens where they are an essential part of the immune system.
