description: 'Initiation of translation in the majority of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs
  depends on the 5''-cap (m7GpppN) and involves ribosomal scanning of the 5'' untranslated
  region (5''-UTR) for an initiating AUG start codon. Therefore, this mechanism is
  often called cap-dependent translation initiation. Proximity to the cap, as well
  as the nucleotides surrounding an AUG codon, influence the efficiency of the start
  site recognition during the scanning process. However, if the recognition site is
  poor enough, scanning ribosomal subunits will ignore and skip potential starting
  AUGs, a phenomenon called leaky scanning. Leaky scanning allows a single mRNA to
  encode several proteins that differ in their amino-termini. Merrick (2010) provides
  an overview of this process and hghlights several features of it that remain incompletely
  understood.<p>Several eukaryotic cell and viral mRNAs initiate translation by an
  alternative mechanism that involves internal initiation rather than ribosomal scanning.
  These mRNAs contain complex nucleotide sequences, called internal ribosomal entry
  sites, where ribosomes bind in a cap-independent manner and start translation at
  the closest downstream AUG codon.<br> Initiation on several viral and cellular mRNAs
  is cap-independent and is mediated by binding of the ribosome to internal ribosome
  entry site (IRES) elements. These elements are often found in characteristically
  long structured regions on the 5''-UTR of an mRNA that may or may not have regulatory
  upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Both of these features on the 5''-end of the
  mRNA hinder ribosomal scanning, and thus promote a cap-independent translation initiation
  mechanism. IRESs act as specific translational enhancers that allow translation
  initiation to occur in response to specific stimuli and under the control of different
  trans-acting factors, as for example when cap-dependent protein synthesis is shut
  off during viral infection. Such regulatory elements have been identified in the
  mRNAs of growth factors, protooncogenes, angiogenesis factors, and apoptosis regulators,
  which are translated under a variety of stress conditions, including hypoxia, serum
  deprivation, irradiation and apoptosis. Thus, cap-independent translational control
  might have evolved to regulate cellular responses in acute but transient stress
  conditions that would otherwise lead to cell death, while the same mechanism is
  of major importance for viral mRNAs to bypass the shutting-off of host protein synthesis
  after infection. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis C virus exemplify
  two distinct mechanisms of IRES-mediated initiation. In contrast to cap-dependent
  initiation, the eIF4A and eIF4G subunits of eIF4F bind immediately upstream of the
  EMCV initiation codon and promote binding of a 43S complex. Accordingly, EMCV initiation
  does not involve scanning and does not require eIF1, eIF1A, and the eIF4E subunit
  of eIF4F. Nonetheless, initiation on some EMCV-like IRESs requires additional non-canonical
  initiation factors, which alter IRES conformation and promote binding of eIF4A/eIF4G.
  Initiation on the hepatitis C virus IRES is simpler: a 43S complex containing only
  eIF2 and eIF3 binds directly to the initiation codon as a result of specific interaction
  of the IRES and the 40S subunit.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=72613
