description: Mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) is crucial in the prodcution
  of energy, especially during fasting and metabolic stress. Fatty acids (FAs) are
  oxidized through 4 reaction mechanisms, and this pathway describes the mitochondrial
  beta-oxidation of dietary long chain fatty acids.
