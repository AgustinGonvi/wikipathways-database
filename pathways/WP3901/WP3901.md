description: Lipid droplets are cytosolic organelles present in nearly all cell types.
  Initially they were considered only as inert lipid-storage sites, but now they are
  recognized to be involved in other functions and even associated with liver and
  kidney disease. Still, the mechanisms for lipid accumulation into the lipid droplet
  are not totally understood. Even though the lipid and protein composition of the
  lipid droplets is highly dynamic, triglycerides and cholesterol esters are the main
  components of them. This pathway features the basic enzymatic steps necessary to
  esterify glycerol and cholesterol.
