description: In humans, creatine is synthesized primarily in the liver and kidney,
  from glycine, arginine, and S-adenosylmethionine, in a sequence of two reactions.
  From the liver, creatine is exported to tissues such as skeletal muscle and brain,
  where it undergoes phosphorylation and serves as a short-term energy store. The
  mechanism by which creatine leaves producer tissues is unclear, but its uptake by
  consumer tissues is mediated by the SLC6A8 transporter.<P>Once formed, phosphocreatine
  undergoes a slow spontaneous reaction to form creatinine, which is excreted from
  the body.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=71288
