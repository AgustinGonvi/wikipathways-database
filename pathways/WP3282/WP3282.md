description: The activation and translocation of transcription factors NFAT, AP-1
  and NF-kappa-B via the co-stimulatory signaling cascade triggered by MHC peptide,
  B7 proteins and PD-L1. The activation of NFAT involves a Ca2+/calcineurin disruption
  of a massive RNA-protein complex prior to its translocation into the nucleus and
  ultimate transcription factor activity.

  - PLC-g is initially brought to the plasma membrane by binding of its PH domain
    to membrane lipid PIP3. PLC-g then binds to LAT and SLP-76 and can be activated
    by Itk mediated phosphorylation.

  - LcK is activated when the extracellular part of CD8 binds its (MHC:peptide) ligand.
    Lck is a Src family kinase that is constitutively expressed. It phosphorylates
    all TCR ITAMS.

  - IP3 is a second messanger that diffuses into the cytosol and binds to IP3 receptors
    on the ER therey opening calcium channels.
  - LCK
  - It docks at the TCR (requires both ITAM positions to be phosphorylated), is then
    phosphorylated by Lck, and then recruits other signaling proteins.

  - PI3K can also bind ICOS

  - 'PLC-g ultimately produces 3 different second messangers to activate 3 paths leading

  - CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for B7 ligand, and it has a higher affinity of B7 in
    part because CTLA-4 binds B7 in a dimer.
  - 'DAG is a membrane protein which can now recruit other signaling molecules to
    the membrane by serving as a binding target. '
  - When CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail is NOT phosphorylated it binds to AP-2 (clathrin
    adapter molecule) and is removed from the surface. When the tail is phosphorylated
    AP-2 cannot bind and CTLA-4 is expressed on the surface.
  - PDCD1
  - Function is controlled largely by regulation of its surface expression. Initially
    CTLA-4 is in the intracellular membrane but moves to the cell surface after T-cell
    receptor signaling.
