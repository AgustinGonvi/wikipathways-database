description: Ulcerative colitis (UC) together with Crohn’s disease (CD) are both chronic
  inflammation disorders in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and subtypes of inflammatory
  bowel disease (IBD). This inflammatory response in the GI tract is a result of various
  environmental and genetic components, microorganisms, and an impaired immune system.
  Among those many factors, changes in the luminal environment of the colonic epithelial
  cells are crucial and remain to be precisely analyzed. This pathway only considered
  UC, in which certain pathogens are found in increased or decreased amounts, compared
  to healthy controls.   In the upper section of the pathway, it is shown that the
  toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognized the components derived from microbes, such
  as flagellin, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipopolysaccharide. As depicted on the left,
  also nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins, and antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) recognized those microbial molecules. Activation of the TLR signaling
  pathway drives the upregulation of NF-kappa-B and its corresponding inflammation
  reaction. At the same time, the APC regulates the shift of naïve T-cells into effector
  T-cells and (Th2) and natural killer (NKT) T-cells. UC is mainly dominated by the
  Th2-type inflammation and the corresponding production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and
  IL-10.
