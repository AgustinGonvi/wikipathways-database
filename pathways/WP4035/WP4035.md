description: Nutrient absorption occurs mostly in the small intestine. Processes annotated
  here include the uptake of dietary cholesterol and phytosterols, and of monosaccharides.
  Movement of the final products of digestion out of the intestinal lumen is mediated
  by arrays of transporters associated with the apical and basolateral surfaces of
  enterocytes (Yamada 2015).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8963676
