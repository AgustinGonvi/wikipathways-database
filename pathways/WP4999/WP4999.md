description: 'FOXO6, the least studied member of the FOXO family, directly stimulates
  transcription of PLXNA4 gene, encoding a co-factor for the semaphorin SEMA3A receptor.
  FOXO6-mediated regulation of PLXNA4 expression plays an important role in radial
  glia migration during cortical development (Paap et al. 2016).<br>FOXO-mediated
  up-regulation of genes involved in reduction of the oxidative stress burden is not
  specific to neurons, but plays an important role in neuronal survival and neurodegenerative
  diseases. FOXO3 and FOXO4, and possibly FOXO1, directly stimulate transcription
  of the SOD2 gene, encoding mitochondrial manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase,
  which converts superoxide to the less harmful hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (Kops
  et al. 2002, Hori et al. 2013, Araujo et al. 2011, Guan et al. 2016). FOXO4 stimulates
  SOD2 gene transcription in collaboration with ATXN3, a protein involved in spinocerebellar
  ataxia type 3 (SCA3) (Araujo et al. 2011). FOXO3 and FOXO6, and possibly FOXO1,
  directly stimulate transcription of the CAT gene, encoding catalase, an enzyme that
  converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, thus protecting cells from the oxidative
  stress (Awad et al. 2014, Kim et al. 2014, Rangarajan et al. 2015, Song et al. 2016,
  Liao et al. 2016, Guo et al. 2016).<br>FOXO transcription factors regulate transcription
  of several genes whose protein products are secreted from hypothalamic neurons to
  control appetite and food intake: NPY gene, AGRP gene and POMC gene. At low insulin
  levels, characteristic of starvation, FOXO transcription factors bind to insulin
  responsive elements (IRES) in the regulatory regions of NPY, AGRP and POMC gene.
  FOXO1 directly stimulates transcription of the NPY gene, encoding neuropeptide-Y
  (Kim et al. 2006, Hong et al. 2012), and the AGRP gene, encoding Agouti-related
  protein (Kitamura et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2006), which both stimulate food intake.
  At the same time, FOXO1 directly represses transcription of the POMC gene, encoding
  melanocyte stimulating hormone alpha , which suppresses food intake (Kitamura et
  al. 2006, Kim et al. 2006). When, upon food intake, blood insulin levels rise, insulin-mediated
  activation of PI3K/AKT signaling inhibits FOXO transcriptional activity.<br>In liver
  cells, FOXO transcription factors regulate transcription of genes involved in gluconeogenesis:
  G6PC gene, encoding glucose-6-phosphatase and PCK1 gene, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase. Actions of G6PC and PCK1 enable steady glucose blood levels during
  fasting. FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 directly stimulate PCK1 gene transcription (Hall
  et al. 2000, Yang et al. 2002, Puigserver et al. 2003), while all four FOXOs, FOXO1,
  FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6 directly stimulate G6PC gene transcription (Yang et al. 2002,
  Puigserver et al. 2003, Onuma et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2011). FOXO-mediated induction
  of G6PC and PCK1 genes is negatively regulated by insulin-induced PI3K/AKT signaling.<br>FOXO1,
  FOXO3 and FOXO4 directly stimulate transcription of the IGFBP1 gene, encoding insulin
  growth factor binding protein 2 (Tang et al. 1999, Kops et al. 1999, Hall et al.
  2000, Yang et al. 2002), which increases sensitivity of cells to insulin.<br>FOXO1
  and FOXO3 directly stimulate transcription of the ABCA6 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family
  A member 6) gene, encoding a putative transporter protein that is thought to be
  involved in lipid homeostasis (Gai et al. 2013). The GCK (glucokinase) gene is another
  gene involved in lipid homeostasis that is regulated by FOXOs. FOXO1, acting with
  the SIN3A:HDAC complex, directly represses the GCK gene transcription, thus repressing
  lipogenesis in the absence of insulin (Langlet et al. 2017). The SREBF1 (SREBP1)
  gene, which encodes a transcriptional activator required for lipid homeostasis,
  is directly transcriptionally repressed by FOXO1 (Deng et al. 2012). Transcription
  of the RETN gene, encoding resistin, an adipocyte specific hormone that suppresses
  insulin-mediated uptake of glucose by adipose cells, is directly stimulated by FOXO1
  (Liu et al. 2014).<br>Transcription of two genes encoding E3 ubiquitin ligases FBXO32
  (Atrogin-1) and TRIM63 (MURF1), involved in degradation of muscle proteins and muscle
  wasting during starvation, is positively regulated by FOXO transcription factors
  (Sandri et al. 2004, Waddell et al. 2008, Raffaello et al. 2010, Senf et al. 2011,
  Bollinger et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2017).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9615017
