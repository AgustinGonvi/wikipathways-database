description: The normal development of the pancreas during gestation has been intensively
  investigated over the past decade especially in the mouse (Servitja and Ferrer 2004;
  Chakrabarti and Mirmira 2003). Studies of genetic defects associated with maturity
  onset diabetes of the young (MODY) has provided direct insight into these processes
  as they take place in humans (Fajans et al. 2001). During embryogenesis, committed
  epithelial cells from the early pancreatic buds differentiate into mature endocrine
  and exocrine cells. It is helpful to schematize this process into four consecutive
  cellular stages, to begin to describe the complex interplay of signal transduction
  pathways and transcriptional networks. The annotations here are by no means complete
  - factors in addition to the ones described here must be active, and even for the
  ones that are described, only key examples of their regulatory effects and interactions
  have been annotated.<p>It is also important to realize that in the human, unlike
  the mouse, cells of the different stages can be present simultaneously in the developing
  pancreas and the linear representation of these developmental events shown here
  is an over-simplification of the actual developmental process (e.g., Sarkar et al.
  2008).<p>The first stage of this process involves the predifferentiated epithelial
  cells of the two pancreatic anlagen that arise from the definitive endoderm at approximately
  somite stages 11-15 and undergo budding from somite stages 20-22. This period corresponds
  to gestational days 8.75-9.5 in the mouse, and 26 in the human.<p>Pancreatic buds
  subsequently coalesce to form a single primitive gland, while concomitantly a ductal
  tree lined by highly proliferative epithelial cells is formed. A subset of such
  epithelial cells is thought to differentiate into either endocrine or acinar exocrine
  cells. A third cellular stage is defined by the endocrine-committed progenitors
  that selectively express the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NEUROG3.
  NEUROG3 is known to activate a complex transcriptional network that is essential
  for the specification of endocrine cells. Many transcription factors that are activated
  by NEUROG3 are also involved in islet-subtype cellular specification and in subsequent
  stages of differentiation of endocrine cells. This transient cellular stage thus
  leads to the generation of all known pancreatic endocrine cells, including insulin-producing
  beta-cells, and glucagon-producing alpha cells, the final stage of this schematic
  developmental process.<p>The diagram below summarizes interactions that take place
  between transcription factors and transcription factor target genes during these
  cellular stages, and shows cases where there is both functional evidence that a
  transcription factor is required for the target gene to be expressed, and biochemical
  evidence that this interaction is direct. We also describe instances where a signaling
  pathway is known to regulate a transcription factor gene in this process, even if
  the intervening signaling pathway is not fully understood.  View original pathway
