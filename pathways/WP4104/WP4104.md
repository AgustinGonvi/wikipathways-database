description: Dietary carbohydrates, fats, and proteins must be broken down to their
  constituent monosaccharides, fatty acids and sterols, and amino acids, respectively,
  before they can be absorbed in the intestine.<br>Dietary lipids such as long-chain
  triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed in the stomach and small
  intestine to yield long-chain fatty acids, monoacylglycerols, glycerol and cholesterol
  through the action of a variety of lipases, and are then absorbed into enterocytes.<br>Carbohydrates
  include starch (amylose and amylopectin) and disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose,
  maltose and, in small amounts, trehalose. The digestion of starch begins with the
  action of amylase enzymes secreted in the saliva and small intestine, which convert
  it to maltotriose, maltose, limit dextrins, and some glucose. Digestion of the limit
  dextrins and disaccharides, both dietary and starch-derived, to monosaccharides
  - glucose, galactose, and fructose - is accomplished by enzymes located on the luminal
  surfaces of enterocytes lining the microvilli of the small intestine.<br>Dietary
  protein is hydrolyzed to dipeptides and amino acids by the action of pepsin in the
  stomach and an array of intestinal hydrolases. All of these enzymes are released
  in inactive (proenzyme) forms and activated by proteolytic cleavage within the gastrointestinal
  lumen (Van Beers et al. 1995; Yamada 2015).   View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=8935690
