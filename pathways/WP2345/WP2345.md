description: 'Biotin-dependent enzymes catalyze carboxylation, decarboxylation, or
  transcarboxylation reactions in the synthesis of fatty acids, isoleucine, and valine,
  and in gluconeogenesis.  In plants, five biotin-containing proteins have been characterized
  so far, only four of them catalysts:  two structurally distinct acetyl-CoA carboxylases,
  3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase and geranoyl-CoA carboxylase.  The fifth is a noncatalytic
  biotin protein that accumulates in seeds and is thought to play a role in storing
  biotin (Nikolau et al., 2003). Biotin is synthesized from pimeloyl-CoA in four steps,
  of which the first is peroxisomal; the other three steps are almost surely mitochondrial.  The
  source of pimeloyl-CoA is not known in plants, but appears to differ from those
  in bacteria (Lin and Cronan, 2011).  One of the possibilities - it might come from
  fatty acid degradation via the concerted action of β-, α-, and ω-oxidation enzymes
  in peroxisomes  (Magliano et al., 2011)  The ligase that attaches biotin to carboxylases
  is present in cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria.  Seed biotin-binding proteins
  are probably biotinylated by a special enzyme, not by the ligases that act on biotin-dependent
  enzymes (Job et al., 2001). Seed biotin-binding proteins may act as biotin reserves;
  if so, a biotinidase is required to cleave the biotin-lysine bond (Alban et al.,
  2000)'
