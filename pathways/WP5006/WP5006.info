description: Peroxisomes are cytosolic organelles involved in the catabolism of branched and long-chain fatty acids and in the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Peroxisomes homeostasis is critical to maintain ROS levels. Consequently, it is important to eliminate dysfunctional peroxisomes. The degradation of peroxisomes by autophagy is known as pexophagy (Katarzyna ZR et al. 2016). Pexophagy can be triggered by a shift in nutrient conditions.
