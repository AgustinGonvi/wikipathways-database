description: 'Ovarian bottleneck genes associated with infertility. A valuable approach
  to the study of infertility is the comparison of mutations of individual human and
  mouse genes associated with infertility phenotypes. The individual gene pages in
  the OKdb (Ovarian Kaleidoscope Database: http://ovary.stanford.edu) contain information
  on associated fertility phenotypes sorted by ovarian and nonovarian defects and
  by subfertility or infertility. If one searches for null mutations (under mutation
  type) causing infertility (infertile - ovarian defect, under female fertility status)
  in mice (under species), 44 gene entries are found. The expression of these infertility
  genes in the oocyte and granulosa cells together with their cellular localization
  is presented in Ovarian Infertility gene map. The theca cell genes are not presented
  because most publications emphasize granulosa cell studies.'
