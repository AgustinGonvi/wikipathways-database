description: Protein pathways altered by mutations in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Pathways
  include epigentic modification, DNA damage checkpoint signals, MYB/MYC signalling
  pathway, FGF/IGF/PI3K signalling, and notch signalling. In the epigenetic modification
  pathway, several complexes promote the activity of HIST1H1E/HIST1H2AL which regulate
  chromatin remodeling. In the DNA damage pathway DNA damage in the nucleus signals
  to ATM and PRKDC to induce DNA repair and suspend the cell cycle. ATM further activates
  proteins that induce either apoptosis or DNA repair and leads to the activation
  of proteins that inhibit progression in the cell cycle. The MYB/MYC pathway involves
  the activation of protein complexes involved in inducing cell growth and proliferation
  by CREBBP and MYCBP. However this pathway has feedback inhibition by the binding
  of the MYBL1/MYB complex to NFIB which depresses MYB activity. The FGF/IGF/PI3K
  signalling pathway involves the activation of the FGFR4/INSRR complex by FGF16 and
  ERBB2 activation by ERBB2IP which leads to a signalling cascade that inhibits apoptosis
  and promotes cell growth and migration. The notch pathway is activated by the biding
  of CNTN6 to Notch leading to pathway activation. This pathway is regulated by RoxP2,
  CTBP1, and DTX4/FBXW7. These pathways are from figure 4 from Ho et al.   Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3651
