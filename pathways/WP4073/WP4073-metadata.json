  "description": "Methylation of lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) residues on non-histone proteins is a prevalent post-translational modification and important regulator of cellular signal transduction pathways including MAPK, WNT, BMP, Hippo and JAK\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSTAT. Crosstalk between methylation and other types of post-translational modifications and between histone and non-histone protein methylation is frequent, affecting cellular functions such as chromatin remodelling, gene transcription, protein synthesis, signal transduction and DNA repair (Biggar & Li 2015).
