description: Methylation of lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg) residues on non-histone
  proteins is a prevalent post-translational modification and important regulator
  of cellular signal transduction pathways including MAPK, WNT, BMP, Hippo and JAKâ€“STAT.
  Crosstalk between methylation and other types of post-translational modifications
  and between histone and non-histone protein methylation is frequent, affecting cellular
  functions such as chromatin remodelling, gene transcription, protein synthesis,
  signal transduction and DNA repair (Biggar & Li 2015).  View original pathway at
