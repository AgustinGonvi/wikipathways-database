description: 'RNA polymerase (Pol) I (one of three eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases)
  is devoted to the transcription of the ribosomal DNA genes, which are found in multiple
  arrayed copies in every eukaryotic cell. These genes encode for the large ribosomal
  RNA precursor, which is then processed into the three largest subunits of the ribosomal
  RNA, the 18S, 28S, and 5.8S RNAs. In human cells the rDNA gene clusters are localized
  on the short arm of the five pairs of the acrocentric chromosomes.  The rRNA promoter
  has two essential and specially spaced sequences: a CORE element and an upstream
  control element (UCE, also called UPE). The CORE element of the human promoter overlaps
  with the transcription start site, extending from 20 to 45, and is required for
  specific initiation of transcription. <br>  The polymerase is a multisubunit complex,
  composed of two large subunits (the most conserved portions include the catalytic
  site that shares similarity with other eukaryotic and bacterial multisubunit RNA
  polymerases) and a number of smaller subunits. Under a number of experimental conditions
  the core is competent to mediate ribonucleic acid synthesis, in vivo however, it
  requires additional factors to select the appropriate template. In humans the RNA
  transcript (45S) is approximately 13,000 nucleotides long. Before leaving the nucleus
  as assembled ribosomal particles, the 45S rRNA is cleaved to give one copy each
  of the 28S rRNA, the 18S rRNA, and the 5.8S rRNA. Equal quantities of the three
  rRNAs are produced by initially transcribing them as one transcript.  View original
