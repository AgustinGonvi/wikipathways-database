description: The pathways hypothesized to be involved in  cardiovascular diseases
  begin with LTBPs and Fibrillins activating a TGFBR complex. The complex can begin
  the canonical TGFB pathway involving SMAD proteins that target gene expression for
  proteins involved in endocardial and epicardial EMT, neural crest migration, ECM
  remodeling, cell differentiation, development and maintenance of cardiovascular
  structure and function. The non-canonical TGFB pathway involves the calcium-calneurin
  signaling pathway that also affects the previously mentioned functions. the TGFBR
  complex also activates SHCA and Tak1 which promote the function of a complex (ERK1/2,
  JNK1, and p38) to regulate the previously mentioned cell functions and influence
  the development of cardiovascular diseases. These diseases are additionally influenced
  by a signalling pathway involving the activation of TGFB ligands, receptors, activators,
  and effectors by ANG2/AT1/2R complex. This pathway is based on figure 1 from Doetschman
  et al.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3668
