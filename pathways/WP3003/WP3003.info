description: This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has been demonstrated in another species.<p>The inference is based on the homology mapping in Ensembl Compara. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities (in input, output and catalyst) have a mapped orthologue/paralogue (for complexes at least 75% of components must have a mapping) are inferred to the other species. High level events are also inferred for these events to allow for easier navigation.<p><a href='/electronic_inference_compara.html' target = 'NEW'>More details and caveats of the event inference in Reactome.</a> For details on the Ensembl Compara system see also: <a href='http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara/homology_method.html' target='NEW'>Gene orthology/paralogy prediction method.</a>  Source:[http://plantreactome.gramene.org/ Plant Reactome].
