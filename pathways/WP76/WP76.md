description: The citric acid cycle, also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA
  cycle) or the Krebs cycle, (or rarely, the Szent-Gyorgyi-Krebs cycle) is a series
  of enzyme-catalysed chemical reactions of central importance in all living cells
  that use oxygen as part of cellular respiration. In eukaryotes, the citric acid
  cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion.
