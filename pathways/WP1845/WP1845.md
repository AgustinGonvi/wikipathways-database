description: MAPKs are protein kinases that, once activated, phosphorylate their specific
  cytosolic or nuclear substrates at serine and/or threonine residues. Such phosphorylation
  events can either positively or negatively regulate substrate, and thus entire signaling
  cascade activity.  <p>The major cytosolic target of activated ERKs are RSKs (90
  kDa Ribosomal protein S6 Kinase). Active RSKs translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates
  such factors as c-Fos(on Ser362), SRF (Serum Response Factor) at Ser103, and CREB
  (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding protein) at Ser133. In the nucleus activated
  ERKs phosphorylate many other targets such as MSKs (Mitogen- and Stress-activated
  protein kinases), MNK (MAP interacting kinase) and Elk1 (on Serine383 and Serine389).
  ERK can directly phosphorylate CREB and  also AP-1 components c-Jun and c-Fos.  Another
  important target of ERK is NF-KappaB. Recent studies reveals that nuclear pore proteins
  are direct substrates for ERK (Kosako H et al, 2009). Other ERK nuclear targets
  include c-Myc, HSF1 (Heat-Shock Factor-1), STAT1/3 (Signal Transducer and Activator
  of Transcription-1/3), and many more transcription factors.</p><p>Activated p38
  MAPK is able to phosphorylate a variety of substrates, including transcription factors
  STAT1, p53, ATF2 (Activating transcription factor 2), MEF2 (Myocyte enhancer factor-2),
  protein kinases MSK1, MNK, MAPKAPK2/3, death/survival molecules (Bcl2, caspases),
  and cell cycle control factors (cyclin D1).</p><p>JNK, once activated, phosphorylates
  a range of nuclear substrates, including transcription factors Jun, ATF, Elk1, p53,
  STAT1/3 and many other factors. JNK has also been shown to directly phosphorylate
  many nuclear hormone receptors. For example, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  1 (PPAR-1) and retinoic acid receptors RXR and RAR are substrates for JNK.  Other
  JNK targets are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K) and the Pol
  I-specific transcription factor TIF-IA, which regulates ribosome synthesis. Other
  adaptor and scaffold proteins have also been characterized as nonnuclear substrates
  of JNK.    View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=450282
