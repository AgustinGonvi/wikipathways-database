description: RHO BTB family belongs to atypical RHO GTPases, which are characterized by the absence of GTPase activity. RhoBTB family includes RHOBTB1, RHOBTB2, and the more divergent RHOBTB3. RHOBTB1 is a component of a signaling cascade that regulates vascular function and blood pressure (Ji and Rivero 2016). RHOBTB2 is involved in COP9 signalosome-regulated and CUL3-dependent protein ubiquitination (Berthold et al. 2008; Ji and Rivero 2016). RHOBTB3 participates in CUL3 dependent protein ubiquitination, vesicle transport, regulation of the cell cycle and modulating the adaptive response to hypoxia (Berthold et al. 2008; Ji and Rivero 2016).
