description: Inflammatory mediators such as growth factors produced by macrophages
  play an important role in the inflammatory response occurring during bacterial infection,
  tissue injury and immune responses. Many growth factors and their receptor-type
  protein tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a critical role in inflammation, wound healing
  and tissue remodelling. The growth factor hepatocyte growth factor-like protein
  (MST1, also known as macrophage-stimulating protein, MSP) binds to a specific receptor,
  macrophage-stimulating protein receptor (MST1R, also known as RON, recepteur d'origine
  nantais). MST1 belongs to the kringle protein family, which includes HGF and plasminogen.
  It is produced by the liver and circulates in the blood as a biologically-inactive
  single chain precursor (pro-MST1). Proteolytic cleavage of pro-MST1 into the biologically-active
  MST1 dimer is necessary for receptor binding. Cleavage occurs during blood coagulation
  and at inflammatory sites, the resultant MST1 dimer then binds MST1R receptors on
  local macrophages. MST1R is ubiquitously expressed but mainly in epithelial cells.<br><br>MST1
  binding to MST1R promotes receptor homodimerisation which in turn allows autophosphorylation
  of two tyrosine residues within the catalytic site which regulates kinase activity
  and allows phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal binding site of the receptor.
  The docking site is essential for downstream signaling through direct and indirect
  binding of SH2 domain-containing adaptor proteins such as GRB2, PI3K, and SRC. MST1/MST1R
  signaling plays a dual role in regulating inflammation; initially stimulating chemotaxis
  and phagocytosis (macrophage activation) and then exerts broad inhibitory effects
  on macrophages, limiting the extent of inflammtory responses (Wang et al. 2002).
  MST1R is upregulated in many epithelial cancers where it is thought to play a role
  in the progression of these types of cancer (Kretschmann et al. 2010).  View original
