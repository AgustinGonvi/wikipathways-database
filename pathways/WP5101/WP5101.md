description: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is divided into four subtypes.
  Type 1 is mainly caused by mutations in AGPAT2 gene, subtype 2 by BSCL2 mutations,
  type  3 by CAV1 mutations and type 4 by CAVIN1 mutations.   Patients with CGL show
  a near total absence of body fat which starts either at birth or shortly after.
  There are also metabolic abnormalities. Type 1 CGL shows loss of metabolically active
  adipose tissue. Type 2 CGL has a general absence of adipose tissue. Patients with
  type 3 CGL show vitamin D resistance, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and have a short
  stature. Patients with type 4 CGL show myopathy, skeletal abnormalities, cardiac
  arrhythmias, pyloric stenosis and gastrointestinal motility problems.
