description: 'Studies in the past decade have suggested that the basic mechanism of
  DNA replication initiation is conserved in all kingdoms of life. Initiation in unicellular
  eukaryotes, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), is well understood,
  and has served as a model for studies of DNA replication initiation in multicellular
  eukaryotes, including humans. In general terms, the first step of initiation is
  the binding of the replication initiator to the origin of replication. The replicative
  helicase is then assembled onto the origin, usually by a helicase assembly factor.
  Either shortly before or shortly after helicase assembly, some local unwinding of
  the origin of replication occurs in a region rich in adenine and thymine bases (often
  termed a DNA unwinding element, DUE). The unwound region provides the substrate
  for primer synthesis and initiation of DNA replication. The best-defined eukaryotic
  origins are those of S. cerevisiae, which have well-conserved sequence elements
  for initiator binding, DNA unwinding and binding of accessory proteins. In multicellular
  eukaryotes, unlike S. cerevisiae, these loci appear not to be defined by the presence
  of a DNA sequence motif. Indeed, choice of replication origins in a multicellular
  eukaryote may vary with developmental stage and tissue type. In cell-free models
  of metazoan DNA replication, such as the one provided by Xenopus egg extracts, there
  are only limited DNA sequence specificity requirements for replication initiation.
