description: Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or Apo 2 ligand
  (TRAIL/Apo2L) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. This group
  of apoptosis induction pathways all work through protein interactions mediated by
  the intracellular death domain (DD), encoded within the cytoplasmic domain of the
  receptor. TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis through its interaction with the Fas-associated
  death domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8/10 (Wang S & el-Deiry WS 2003; Sprick
  MR et al. 2002). TRAIL and its receptors, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, were shown to be
  rapidly endocytosed via clathrin-dependent and -independent manner in human Burkitt's
  lymphoma B cells (BJAB) (Kohlhaas SL et al. 2007). However, FADD and caspase-8 were
  able to bind TRAIL-R1/R2 in TRAIL-stimulated BJAB cells at 4<sup>o</sup>C (at which
  membrane trafficking is inhibited), suggesting that the endocytosis was not required
  for an assembly of the functional TRAIL DISC complex. Moreover, blocking of clathrin-dependent
  endocytosis did not interfere with the capacity of TRAIL to promote apoptosis (Kohlhaas
  SL et al. 2007).<br>  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=75158
