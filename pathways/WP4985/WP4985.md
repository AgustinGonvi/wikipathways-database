description: Triglycerides stored in lipid droplets are hydrolysed under nutrient
  starvation to release fatty acids for energy. The content of lipid droplets may
  vary but they are all coated with a protective protein called perilipin. When this
  protein is degraded, lipid droplets associate with autophagic components and breakdown
  into fatty acids (Ward C et al. 2016, Schulze R J et al. 2017). This process is
  termed as lipophagy (Singh R et al. 2009).  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=9613354
