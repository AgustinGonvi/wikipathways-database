description: This pathways describes the synthesis and degradation reactions of starch
  in the chloroplast.The metabolic link with the Calvin-Benson Cycle, Sucrose Metabolism
  and Glycolysis are indicated. Protein identifiers for A. thaliana are from UNIPROT.
  The pathway is inspired from information drawn for Plant Physiology (Taiz and Zeiger)
  Third Edition and KEGG Pathways.
