description: 'POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2, and NANOG bind elements in the promoters of target
  genes. The target genes of each transcription factor overlap extensively: POU5F1,
  SOX2, and NANOG co-occupy at least 353 genes (Boyer et al. 2005). About half of
  POU5F1 targets also bind SOX2 and about 90% of these also bind NANOG (Boyer et al.
  2005). Upon binding the transcription factors activate expression of one subset
  of target genes in the core transcriptional network of pluripotent stem cells and
  repress another subset (Kim et al. 2006, Matoba et al. 2006, Player et al. 2006,
  Assou et al. 2007, Babaie et al. 2007, Chavez et al. 2009, Jung et al. 2010). The
  target genes listed in this module are the repressed genes. Caution must be used
  when making inferences about human stem cells from mouse stem cells because of significant
  differences between the two species (Ginis et al. 2004).  View original pathway
