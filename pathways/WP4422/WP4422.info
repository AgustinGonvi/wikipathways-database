description: The heterotrimeric G protein G alpha (z), is a member of the G (i) family. Unlike other G alpha (i) family members it lacks an ADP ribosylation site cysteine four residues from the carboxyl terminus and is thus pertussis toxin-insensitive. It inhibits adenylyl cyclase types I, V and VI (Wong Y H et al. 1992). G alpha (z) interacts with the Rap1 GTPase activating protein (Rap1GAP) to attenuate Rap1 signaling. Like all G-proteins G alpha (z) has an intrinsic GTPase activity, but this activity tends to be lower for the pertussis toxin insensitive G-proteins, most strikingly so for G alpha (z), whose kcat value for GTP hydrolysis is 200-fold lower than those of G alpha (s) or G alpha (i) (Grazziano et al. 1989). G alpha (z) knockout mice have disrupted platelet aggregation at physiological concentrations of epinephrine and responses to several neuroactive drugs are altered (Yang et al. 2000). Regulator of G-protein Signalling (RGS) proteins can regulate the activity of G alpha (z) (Soundararajan M et al. 2008).
