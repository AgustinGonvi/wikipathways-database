description: This pathway provides an overview of the directed differentiation molecules
  used to induce early and derivative cell lineages from human pluripotent stem cells.
  This overview differentiates between the three primary germ cell layers (ectoderm-outer
  layer, endoderm-inner layer, mesoderm-middle layer), which are formed in the earliest
  state of embryonic development and give rise to different tissue types. The initial
  version of this pathway is a direct adaptation of the SnapShot "Directed Differentiation
  of Pluripotent Stem Cells" pathway authored by Luis A. Williams, Brandi N. Davis-Dusenbery,
  and Kevin C. Eggan, HHMI, Harvard University, Cell 149, May 25, 2012 Elsevier Inc.
  DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.015. http://download.cell.com/pdf/PIIS0092867412005946.pdf.
  This adaptation was generated by Meenakshi Venkatasubramanian and Krithika Ramasamy
  Subramanian at Cincinnati Children's Hospital in the laboratory of Nathan Salomonis.  Proteins
  on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2848
