description: "<b>OVERVIEW OF TRANSCRIPTION REGULATION:</b>  <br><br>Detailed studies
  of gene transcription regulation in a wide variety of eukaryotic systems has revealed
  the general principles and mechanisms by which cell- or tissue-specific regulation
  of differential gene transcription is mediated (reviewed in Naar, 2001. Kadonaga,
  2004, Maston, 2006, Barolo, 2002; Roeder, 2005, Rosenfeld, 2006).  Of the three
  major classes of DNA polymerase involved in eukaryotic gene transcription, Polymerase
  II generally regulates protein-encoding genes.   Figure 1 shows a diagram of the
  various components involved in cell-specific regulation of Pol-II gene transcription.
  <br><br>Core Promoter: Pol II-regulated genes typically have a Core Promoter where
  Pol II and a variety of general factors bind to specific DNA motifs: <br>   i: the
  TATA box (TATA DNA sequence), which is bound by the \"TATA-binding protein\" (TBP).<br>
  \  ii: the Initiator motif (INR), where Pol II and certain other core factors bind,
  is present in many Pol II-regulated genes.<br>   iii: the Downstream Promoter Element
  (DPE), which is present in a subset of Pol II genes, and where additional core factors
  bind.  <br>The core promoter binding factors are generally ubiquitously expressed,
  although there are exceptions to this.<br><br>Proximal Promoter: immediately upstream
  (5') of the core promoter, Pol II target genes often have a Proximal Promoter region
  that spans up to 500 base pairs (b.p.), or even to 1000 b.p..  This region contains
  a number of functional DNA binding sites for a specific set of transcription activator
  (TA) and transcription repressor (TR) proteins.  These TA and TR factors are generally
  cell- or tissue-specific in expression, rather than ubiquitous, so that the presence
  of their cognate binding sites in the proximal promoter region programs cell- or
  tissue-specific expression of the target gene, perhaps in conjunction with TA and
  TR complexes bound in distal enhancer regions.  <br><br>Distal Enhancer(s): many
  or most Pol II regulated genes in higher eukaryotes have one or more distal Enhancer
  regions which are essential for proper regulation of the gene, often in a cell or
  tissue-specific pattern.  Like the proximal promoter region, each of the distal
  enhancer regions typically contain a cluster of binding sites for specific TA and/or
  TR DNA-binding factors, rather than just a single site. <br><br>   Enhancers generally
  have three defining characteristics:<br>     i: They can be located very long distances
  from the promoter of the target gene they regulate, sometimes as far as 100 Kb,
  or more.<br>     ii: They can be either upstream (5') or downstream (3') of the
  target gene, including within introns of that gene.<br>     iii: They can function
  in either orientation in the DNA.<br><br>Combinatorial mechanisms of transcription
  regulation: The specific combination of TA and TR binding sites within the proximal
  promoter and/or distal enhancer(s) provides a \"combinatorial transcription code\"
  that mediates cell- or tissue-specific expression of the associated target gene.
  \ Each promoter or enhancer region mediates expression in a specific subset of the
  overall expression pattern.  In at least some cases, each enhancer region functions
  completely independently of the others, so that the overall expression pattern is
  a linear combination of the expression patterns of each of the enhancer modules.<br><br>Co-Activator
  and Co-Repressor Complexes:  DNA-bound TA and TR proteins typically recruit the
  assembly of specific Co-Activator (Co-A) and Co-Repressor (Co-R) Complexes, respectively,
  which are essential for regulating target gene transcription.  Both Co-A's and Co-R's
  \ are multi-protein complexes that contain several specific protein components.<br><br>Co-Activator
  complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone Acetyl
  Transferase (HAT) enzymatic activity.  This functions to acetylate Histones and/or
  other chromatin-associated factors, which typically increases that transcription
  activation of the target gene.  By contrast, Co-Repressor complexes generally contain
  at lease one component protein that has Histone De-Acetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity.
  \ This functions to de-acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors.
  This typically increases the transcription repression of the target gene.<br><br>Adaptor
  (Mediator) complexes: In addition to the co-activator complexes that assemble on
  particular cell-specific TA factors,  - there are at least two additional transcriptional
  co-activator complexes common to most cells.  One of these is the Mediator complex,
  which functions as an \"adaptor\" complex that bridges between the tissue-specific
  co-activator complexes assembled in the proximal promoter (or distal enhancers).
  \ The human Mediator complex has been shown to contain at least 19 protein distinct
  components.  Different combinations of these co-activator proteins are also found
  to be components of specific transcription Co-Activator complexes, such as the DRIP,
  TRAP and ARC complexes described below.  <br><br>TBP/TAF complex: Another large
  Co-A complex is the \"TBP-associated factors\" (TAFs) that assemble on TBP (TATA-Binding
  Protein), which is bound to the TATA box present in many promoters.  There are at
  least 23 human TAF proteins that have been identified.  Many of these are ubiquitously
  expressed, but TAFs can also be expressed in a cell or tissue-specific pattern.
  \ <br><br>   <b>\tSpecific Coactivator Complexes for DNA-binding Transcription Factors.</b>
  \  <br><br>A number of specific co-activator complexes for DNA-binding transcription
  factors have been identified, including DRIP, TRAP, and ARC (reviewed in Bourbon,
  2004, Blazek, 2005, Conaway, 2005, and Malik, 2005).  The DRIP co-activator complex
  was originally identified and named as a specific complex associated with the Vitamin
  D Receptor member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors (Rachez,
  1998).  Similarly, the TRAP co-activator complex was originally identified as a
  complex that associates with the thyroid receptor (Yuan, 1998).   It was later determined
  that all of the components of the DRIP complex are also present in the TRAP complex,
  and the ARC complex (discussed further below).  For example, the DRIP205 and TRAP220
  proteins were show to be identical, as were specific pairs of the other components
  of these complexes (Rachez, 1999).<br><br>In addition, these various transcription
  co-activator proteins identified in mammalian cells were found to be the orthologues
  or homologues of the Mediator (\"adaptor\") complex proteins (reviewed in Bourbon,
  2004).  The Mediator proteins were originally identified in yeast  by Kornberg and
  colleagues, as complexes associated with DNA polymerase (Kelleher, 1990).  In higher
  organisms, Adapter complexes bridge between the basal transcription factors (including
  Pol II) and tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) bound to sites within upstream
  Proximal Promoter regions or distal Enhancer regions (Figure 1).  However, many
  of the Mediator homologues can also be found in complexes associated with specific
  transcription factors in higher organisms.  A unified nomenclature system for these
  adapter / co-activator proteins now labels them Mediator 1 through Mediator 31 (Bourbon,
  2004).  For example, the DRIP205 / TRAP220 proteins are now identified as Mediator
  1 (Rachez, 1999), based on homology with yeast Mediator 1.<br><br>    <b>Example
  Pathway: Specific Regulation of Target Genes During Notch Signaling:</b> <br><br>One
  well-studied example of cell-specific regulation of gene transcription is selective
  regulation of target genes during Notch signaling.  Notch signaling was first identified
  in Drosophila, where it has been studied in detail at the genetic, molecular, biochemical
  and cellular levels (reviewed in Justice, 2002; Bray, 2006; Schweisguth, 2004; Louvri,
  2006).  In Drosophila, Notch signaling to the nucleus is thought always to be mediated
  by one specific DNA binding transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless.  In mammals,
  the homologous genes are called CBF1 (or RBPJkappa), while in worms they are called
  Lag-1, so that the acronym \"CSL\" has been given to this conserved transcription
  factor family.  There are at least two human CSL homologues, which are now named
  RBPJ and RBPJL.  <br><br>In Drosophila, Su(H) is known to be bifunctional, in that
  it represses target gene transcription in the absence of Notch signaling, but activates
  target genes during Notch signaling.  At least some of the mammalian CSL homologues
  are believed also to be bifunctional, and to mediate target gene repression in the
  absence of Notch signaling, and activation in the presence of Notch signaling.<br><br>Notch
  Co-Activator and Co-Repressor complexes: This repression is mediated by at least
  one specific co-repressor complexes (Co-R) bound to CSL in the absence of Notch
  signaling.  In Drosophila, this co-repressor complex consists of at least three
  distinct co-repressor proteins: Hairless, Groucho, and dCtBP (Drosophila C-terminal
  Binding Protein).  Hairless has been show to bind directly to Su(H), and Groucho
  and dCtBP have been shown to bind directly to Hairless (Barolo, 2002).  All three
  of the co-repressor proteins have been shown to be necessary for proper gene regulation
  during Notch signaling in vivo (Nagel, 2005).<br><br>In mammals, the same general
  pathway and mechanisms are observed, where CSL proteins are bifunctional DNA binding
  transcription factors (TFs), that bind to Co-Repressor complexes to mediate repression
  in the absence of Notch signaling, and bind to Co-Activator  complexes to mediate
  activation in the presence of Notch signaling.  However, in mammals, there may be
  multiple co-repressor complexes, rather than the single Hairless co-repressor complex
  that has been observed in Drosophila.  <br><br>During Notch signaling in all systems,
  the Notch transmembrane receptor is cleaved and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD)
  translocates to the nucleus, where it there functions as a specific transcription
  co-activator for CSL proteins.  In the nucleus, NICD replaces the Co-R complex bound
  to CSL, thus resulting in de-repression of  Notch target genes in the nucleus (Figure
  2).  Once bound to CSL, NICD and CSL proteins recruit an additional co-activator
  protein, Mastermind, to form a CSL-NICD-Mam ternary co-activator (Co-A) complex.
  \ This Co-R  complex was initially thought to be sufficient to mediate activation
  of  at least some Notch target genes.  However, there now is evidence that still
  other co-activators and additional DNA-binding transcription factors are required
  in at least some contexts (reviewed in Barolo, 2002).  <br><br>Thus, CSL is a good
  example of a bifunctional DNA-binding transcription factor that mediates repression
  of specific targets genes in one context, but activation of the same targets in
  another context.  This bifunctionality is mediated by the association of specific
  Co-Repressor complexes vs. specific Co-Activator complexes in different contexts,
  namely in the absence or presence of Notch signaling.  View original pathway at
