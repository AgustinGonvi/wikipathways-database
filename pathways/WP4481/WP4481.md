description: Resistin induced intracellular signaling pathways. No receptor for resistin
  has yet been identified. Resistin induces NF-kB activity. Resistin increases the
  cytosolic Ca concentration via both PLC activation, leading to the release of Ca
  from intracellular pools, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, and Ca influx from
  the extracellular environment. Activation of the abovementioned signaling pathways
  via resistin suggests that it has proinflammatory potential.
