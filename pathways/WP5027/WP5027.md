description: The pathway depicted how nsp1 from SARS-CoV 2 may inhibit translation
  in the host cell (Yuan S et al 2020, PubMed 33188728). nsp1 protein competes with
  the EIF3J subunit of the EIF3s complex for binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit.
  The resulted 43S pre-initiation complex can no longer load the mRNA from the host
  cell for starting translation.
