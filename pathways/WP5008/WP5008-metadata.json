  "description": "The family of FOXO transcription factors includes FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6. FOXO transcription factors integrate pathways that regulate cell survival, growth, differentiation and metabolism in response to environmental changes, such as growth factor deprivation, starvation and oxidative stress (reviewed by Accili and Arden 2004, Calnan and Brunet 2008, Eijkelenboom and Burgering 2013).
