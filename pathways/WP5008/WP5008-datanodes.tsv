FOXO-mediated
transcription of
cell death genes	Pathway	R-HSA-9614657	Reactome	FOXO transcription factors promote expression of several pro-apoptotic genes, such as FASLG (Brunet et al. 1999, Ciechomska et al. 2003, Chen et al. 2013, Li et al. 2015), PINK1 (Mei et al. 2009, Sengupta et al. 2011), BCL2L11 (BIM) (Gilley et al. 2003, Urbich et al. 2005, Chuang et al. 2007, Hughes et al. 2011, Chen et al. 2013, Wang et al. 2016), BCL6 (Tang et al. 2002, Fernandez de Mattos et al. 2004, Shore et al. 2006) and BBC3 (PUMA) (Dudgeon et al. 2010, Hughes et al. 2011, Liu et al. 2015, Wu et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2017, Fitzwalter et al. 2018). FOXO-mediated induction of cell death genes is important during development, for example during nervous system development, where FOXO promotes neuronal death upon NGF withdrawal (Gilley et al. 2003), and also contributes to the tumor-suppressive role of FOXO factors (Arimoto Ishida et al. 2004). FOXO1 transcriptional activity is implicated in the cell death of enteric nervous system (ENS) precursors. RET signaling, which activates PI3K/AKT signaling, leading to inhibition of FOXO mediated transcription, ensures survival of ENS precursors (Srinivasan et al. 2005).<br>Transcription of the STK11 (LKB1) gene, encoding Serine/threonine-protein kinase STK11 (also known as Liver kinase B1), which regulates diverse cellular processes, including apoptosis, is directly stimulated by FOXO3 and FOXO4 (Lutzner et al. 2012).

FOXO-mediated
transcription of
cell cycle genes	Pathway	R-HSA-9617828	Reactome	FOXO transcription factors induce expression of several genes that negatively regulate proliferation of different cell types, such as erythroid progenitors (Bakker et al. 2004, Wang et al. 2015) and neuroepithelial progenitor cells in the telencephalon (Seoane et al. 2004).<br>Transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors CDKN1A (p21Cip1) is directly stimulated by FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 (Seoane et al. 2004, Tinkum et al. 2013). FOXO transcription factors can cooperate with the SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex to induce CDKN1A transcription in response to TGF-beta signaling (Seoane et al. 2004).<br>FOXO transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 stimulate transcription of the CDKN1B (p27Kip1) gene, but direct binding of FOXOs to the CDKN1B gene locus has not been demonstrated (Dijkers et al. 2000, Medema et al. 2000, Lees et al. 2008).<br>FOXO3 and FOXO4, and possibly FOXO1, directly stimulate transcription of the GADD45A  gene (Tran et al. 2002, Furukawa Hibi et al. 2002, Hughes et al. 2011, Sengupta et al. 2011, Ju et al. 2014).<br>Transcription of the retinoblastoma family protein RBL2 (p130), involved in the maintenance of quiescent (G0) state, is directly stimulated by FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 (Kops et al. 2002, Chen et al. 2006).<br>Transcription of the anti-proliferative protein CCNG2 is directly stimulated by FOXO1 and FOXO3, and possibly FOXO4 (Martinez Gac et al. 2004, Chen et al. 2006). Transcription of the anti-proliferative protein BTG1 is directly stimulated by FOXO3 (Bakker et al. 2004, Bakker et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2015).<br>Transcription of CAV1, encoding caveolin-1, involved in negative regulation of growth factor receptor signaling and establishment of quiescent cell phenotype, is directly stimulated by FOXO1 and FOXO3 (van den Heuvel et al. 2005, Roy et al. 2008, Nho et al. 2013, Sisci et al. 2013).<br>FOXO1 and FOXO3 promote transcription of the KLF4 gene, encoding a transcription factor Krueppel-like factor 4, which inhibits proliferation of mouse B cells (Yusuf et al. 2008).<br> FOXO1, together with the p-2S-SMAD2/3:SMAD4 complex, stimulates transcription of the MSTN gene, encoding myostatin, a TGF-beta family member that stimulates differentiation of myoblasts (Allen and Unterman 2007).

FOXO-mediated
transcription of
oxidative stress,
metabolic and
neuronal genes	Pathway	R-HSA-9615017	Reactome	FOXO6, the least studied member of the FOXO family, directly stimulates transcription of PLXNA4 gene, encoding a co-factor for the semaphorin SEMA3A receptor. FOXO6-mediated regulation of PLXNA4 expression plays an important role in radial glia migration during cortical development (Paap et al. 2016).<br>FOXO-mediated up-regulation of genes involved in reduction of the oxidative stress burden is not specific to neurons, but plays an important role in neuronal survival and neurodegenerative diseases. FOXO3 and FOXO4, and possibly FOXO1, directly stimulate transcription of the SOD2 gene, encoding mitochondrial manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, which converts superoxide to the less harmful hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (Kops et al. 2002, Hori et al. 2013, Araujo et al. 2011, Guan et al. 2016). FOXO4 stimulates SOD2 gene transcription in collaboration with ATXN3, a protein involved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) (Araujo et al. 2011). FOXO3 and FOXO6, and possibly FOXO1, directly stimulate transcription of the CAT gene, encoding catalase, an enzyme that converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, thus protecting cells from the oxidative stress (Awad et al. 2014, Kim et al. 2014, Rangarajan et al. 2015, Song et al. 2016, Liao et al. 2016, Guo et al. 2016).<br>FOXO transcription factors regulate transcription of several genes whose protein products are secreted from hypothalamic neurons to control appetite and food intake: NPY gene, AGRP gene and POMC gene. At low insulin levels, characteristic of starvation, FOXO transcription factors bind to insulin responsive elements (IRES) in the regulatory regions of NPY, AGRP and POMC gene. FOXO1 directly stimulates transcription of the NPY gene, encoding neuropeptide-Y (Kim et al. 2006, Hong et al. 2012), and the AGRP gene, encoding Agouti-related protein (Kitamura et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2006), which both stimulate food intake. At the same time, FOXO1 directly represses transcription of the POMC gene, encoding melanocyte stimulating hormone alpha , which suppresses food intake (Kitamura et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2006). When, upon food intake, blood insulin levels rise, insulin-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT signaling inhibits FOXO transcriptional activity.<br>In liver cells, FOXO transcription factors regulate transcription of genes involved in gluconeogenesis: G6PC gene, encoding glucose-6-phosphatase and PCK1 gene, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Actions of G6PC and PCK1 enable steady glucose blood levels during fasting. FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 directly stimulate PCK1 gene transcription (Hall et al. 2000, Yang et al. 2002, Puigserver et al. 2003), while all four FOXOs, FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6 directly stimulate G6PC gene transcription (Yang et al. 2002, Puigserver et al. 2003, Onuma et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2011). FOXO-mediated induction of G6PC and PCK1 genes is negatively regulated by insulin-induced PI3K/AKT signaling.<br>FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 directly stimulate transcription of the IGFBP1 gene, encoding insulin growth factor binding protein 2 (Tang et al. 1999, Kops et al. 1999, Hall et al. 2000, Yang et al. 2002), which increases sensitivity of cells to insulin.<br>FOXO1 and FOXO3 directly stimulate transcription of the ABCA6 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 6) gene, encoding a putative transporter protein that is thought to be involved in lipid homeostasis (Gai et al. 2013). The GCK (glucokinase) gene is another gene involved in lipid homeostasis that is regulated by FOXOs. FOXO1, acting with the SIN3A:HDAC complex, directly represses the GCK gene transcription, thus repressing lipogenesis in the absence of insulin (Langlet et al. 2017). The SREBF1 (SREBP1) gene, which encodes a transcriptional activator required for lipid homeostasis, is directly transcriptionally repressed by FOXO1 (Deng et al. 2012). Transcription of the RETN gene, encoding resistin, an adipocyte specific hormone that suppresses insulin-mediated uptake of glucose by adipose cells, is directly stimulated by FOXO1 (Liu et al. 2014).<br>Transcription of two genes encoding E3 ubiquitin ligases FBXO32 (Atrogin-1) and TRIM63 (MURF1), involved in degradation of muscle proteins and muscle wasting during starvation, is positively regulated by FOXO transcription factors (Sandri et al. 2004, Waddell et al. 2008, Raffaello et al. 2010, Senf et al. 2011, Bollinger et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2017).

PIP3 activates AKT
signaling	Pathway	R-HSA-1257604	Reactome	Signaling by AKT is one of the key outcomes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. AKT is activated by the cellular second messenger PIP3, a phospholipid that is generated by PI3K. In ustimulated cells, PI3K class IA enzymes reside in the cytosol as inactive heterodimers composed of p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. In this complex, p85 stabilizes p110 while inhibiting its catalytic activity. Upon binding of extracellular ligands to RTKs, receptors dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation. The regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, is recruited to phosphorylated cytosolic RTK domains either directly or indirectly, through adaptor proteins, leading to a conformational change in the PI3K IA heterodimer that relieves inhibition of the p110 catalytic subunit. Activated PI3K IA phosphorylates PIP2, converting it to PIP3; this reaction is negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. PIP3 recruits AKT to the plasma membrane, allowing TORC2 to phosphorylate a conserved serine residue of AKT. Phosphorylation of this serine induces a conformation change in AKT, exposing a conserved threonine residue that is then phosphorylated by PDPK1 (PDK1). Phosphorylation of both the threonine and the serine residue is required to fully activate AKT. The active AKT then dissociates from PIP3 and phosphorylates a number of cytosolic and nuclear proteins that play important roles in cell survival and metabolism. For a recent review of AKT signaling, please refer to Manning and Cantley, 2007.
