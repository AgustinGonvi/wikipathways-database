description: 'Diagrammatic scheme depicting potential survival pathway-related gene
  targets of the downregulated microRNAs and their signaling pathways in prostate
  cancer cells. An integrated in silico and computational prediction databases (DIANA-micro
  T-CDS, miRBase, and TargetScan) were employed to predict potential targets of a
  subset of highly downregulated miRNAs (>2-fold) in prostate tumors. Note that some
  targeting miRNAs were removed from the original publication figure for clarity.
  These are represented in supplementary table S3: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1535370216681554.'
