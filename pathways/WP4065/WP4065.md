description: Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is one of a number of process that
  control the uptake of material from the plasma membrane, and leads to the formation
  of clathrin-coated vesicles (Pearse et al, 1975; reviewed in Robinson, 2015; McMahon
  and Boucrot, 2011; Kirchhausen et al, 2014).  CME contributes to signal transduction
  by regulating the cell surface expression and signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).  Most RTKs exhibit a robust increase
  in internalization rate after binding specific ligands; however, some RTKs may also
  exhibit significant ligand-independent internalization (reviewed in Goh and Sorkin,
  2013). CME controls RTK and GPCR signaling by organizing signaling both within the
  plasma membrane and on endosomes (reviewed in Eichel et al, 2016; Garay et al, 2015;
  Vieira et al, 1996; Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2014; Di Fiori and von Zastrow, 2014;
  Barbieri et al, 2016). CME also contributes to the uptake of material such as metabolites,
  hormones and other proteins from the extracellular space, and regulates membrane
  composition by recycling membrane components and/or targeting them for degradation.
  <br><br><br>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves initiation of clathrin-coated
  pit (CCP) formation, cargo selection, coat assembly and stabilization, membrane
  scission and vesicle uncoating.  Although for simplicity in this pathway, the steps
  leading to a mature CCP are represented in a linear and temporally distinct fashion,
  the formation of a clathrin-coated vesicle is a highly heterogeneous process and
  clear temporal boundaries between these processes may not exist (see for instance
  Taylor et al, 2011; Antonescu et al, 2011; reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014).
  Cargo selection in particular is a critical aspect of the formation of a mature
  and stable CCP, and many of the proteins involved in the initiation and maturation
  of a CCP contribute to cargo selection and are themselves stabilized upon incorporation
  of cargo into the nascent vesicle (reviewed in Kirchhausen et al, 2014; McMahon
  and Boucrot, 2011).<br><br><br><br>Although the clathrin triskelion was identified
  early as a major component of the coated vesicles, clathrin does not bind directly
  to membranes or to the endocytosed cargo.  Vesicle formation instead relies on many
  proteins and adaptors that can bind the plasma membrane and interact with cargo
  molecules. Cargo selection depends on the recognition of endocytic signals in cytoplasmic
  tails of the cargo proteins by adaptors that interact with components of the vesicle's
  inner coat.  The classic adaptor for clathrin-coated vesicles is the tetrameric
  AP-2 complex, which along with clathrin was identified early as a major component
  of the coat.  Some cargo indeed bind directly to AP-2, but subsequent work has revealed
  a large family of proteins collectively known as CLASPs (clathrin- associated sorting
  proteins) that mediate the recruitment of diverse cargo into the emerging clathrin-coated
  vesicles (reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino, 2013).  Many of these CLASP proteins
  themselves interact with AP-2 and clathrin, coordinating cargo recruitment with
  coat formation (Schmid et al, 2006; Edeling et al, 2006; reviewed in Traub and Bonifacino,
  2013; Kirchhausen et al, 2014).  <br><br><br>Initiation of CCP formation is also
  influenced by lipid composition, regulated by clathrin-associated phosphatases and
  kinases (reviewed in Picas et al, 2016). The plasma membrane is enriched in PI(4,5)P2.  Many
  of the proteins involved in initiating clathrin-coated pit formation bind to PI(4,5)P2
  and induce membrane curvature through their BAR domains (reviewed in McMahon and
  Boucrot, 2011; Daumke et al, 2014).  Epsin also contributes to early membrane curvature
  through its Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, which promotes membrane curvature
  by inserting into the lipid bilayer (Ford et al, 2002). <br><br>Following initiation,
  some CCPs progress to formation of vesicles, while others undergo disassembly at
  the cell surface without producing vesicles (Ehrlich et al, 2004; Loerke et al,
  2009; Loerke et al, 2011; Aguet et al, 2013; Taylor et al, 2011). The assembly and
  stabilization of nascent CCPs is regulated by several proteins and lipids (Mettlen
  et al, 2009; Antonescu et al, 2011).<br><br><br>Maturation of the emerging clathrin-coated
  vesicle is accompanied by further changes in the lipid composition of the membrane
  and increased membrane curvature, promoted by the recruitment of N-BAR domain containing
  proteins (reviewed in Daumke et al, 2014; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012; Picas et
  al, 2016). Some N-BAR domain containing proteins also contribute to the recruitment
  of the large GTPase dynamin, which is responsible for scission of the mature vesicle
  from the plasma membrane (Koh et al, 2007; Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003; Soulet et
  al, 2005; David et al, 1996; Owen et al, 1998; Shupliakov et al, 1997; Taylor et
  al, 2011; Ferguson et al, 2009; Aguet et al, 2013; Posor et al, 2013; Chappie et
  al, 2010; Shnyrova et al, 2013; reviewed in Mettlen et al, 2009; Daumke et al, 2014).  After
  vesicle scission, the clathrin coat is dissociated from the new vesicle by the ATPase
  HSPA8 (also known as HSC70) and its DNAJ cofactor auxilin, priming the vesicle for
  fusion with a subsequent endocytic compartment and releasing clathrin for reuse  (reviewed
  in McMahon and Boucrot, 2011; Sousa and Laufer, 2015).  View original pathway at
