description: 'The core of this pathway was elucidated over a century ago and involves
  the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I) by renin, its subsequent
  conversion to angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin converting enzyme. Ang II activates
  the angiotensin II receptor type 1 to induce aldosterone synthesis, increasing water
  and salt resorption and potassium excretion in the kidney and increasing blood pressure.  Source:

  targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP554
