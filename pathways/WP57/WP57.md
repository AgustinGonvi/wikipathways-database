description: This is a representation of figure 2 from T. Hla, et al. 2001, Science,
  294, pg. 1877.  Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a signaling sphingolipid, also
  known as lysosphingolipid. It is also referred to as a bioactive lipid mediator.
  Sphingolipids at large form a class of lipids characterized by a particular aliphatic
  aminoalcohol, which is sphingosine.
