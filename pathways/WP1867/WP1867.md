description: Nephrin (NPHS1) is a member of the Super-IgG-Molecule family and is most
  prominently expressed in kidney podocytes. It is a major if not the most important
  structural component of the slit diaphragm, a modified adherens junction inbetween
  these cells. NPHS1 has an extracellular domain that contains eight distal IgG like
  domains and one proximal fibronectin type III domain, a transmembrane domain and
  a short intracellular domain. NPHS1 molecules show both homophilic and heterophilic
  interactions. Among heterophilic interaction partners, slit diaphragm proteins such
  as Kin of IRRE-like protein 1 (KIRREL, Nephrin-like protein 1, NEPH1),  KIRREL3
  (NEPH2) and KIRREL2 (NEPH3) were shown to stabilize the slit diaphragm structure.
  Intracellularly Podocin (NPHS2), CD2 associated protein (CD2AP) and adherins junction
  associated proteins like IQGAP, MAGI, CASK and spectrins all interact with NPHS1.
  Hence it seems to play a major role in organizing the molecular structure of the
  slit diaphragm itself and via its binding partners links it to the actin cytoskeleton.
  NPHS1 tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src kinase FYN initiates the PI3K-AKT signaling
  cascade, which seems to promote antiapoptotic signals.  View original pathway at
