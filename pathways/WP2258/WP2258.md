description: Gibberella zeae (Fusarium graminearum) is a fungal pathogen of major
  staple food crops including wheat, maize and rice. The fungus produces a range of
  mycotoxins including the dexoynivalenol (DON) trichothecene mycotoxin. DON contamination
  of food crops is a major thread to human and animal health. In wheat, but not in
  maize, DON was proven to be a virulence factor. Also see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomitoxin
  Wikipedia article on Vomitoxin].
