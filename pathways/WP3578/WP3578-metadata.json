  "description": "After passing through the Golgi complex, secretory cargo is packaged into post-Golgi transport intermediates (post-Golgi), which translocate plus-end directed along microtubules to the plasma membrane. There at least two classes of clathrin coated vesicles in cells, one predominantly Golgi-associated, involved in budding from the trans-Golgi network and the other at the plasma membrane. Here the clathrin-coated vesicles emerging from the Golgi apparatus are triggered by the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex, AP-1 at the trans-Golgi network membrane. The cargo can be transmembrane, membrane associated or golgi luminal proteins. Each step in the vesicle sculpting pathway, gathers cargo and clathrin triskeletons, until a complete vesicular sphere is formed. With the scission of the membrane the vesicle is released and eventually losses its clathrin coat.  View original pathway at [http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=199992 Reactome].",
