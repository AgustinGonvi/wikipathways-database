description: Complete fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway for saturated and unsaturated
  fatty acids, developed and curated internally by BiGCaT Bioinformatics.   This pathway
  was previously split into three parts plus a meta file for statistics. If you still
  have these you can replace all four with this single pathway.
