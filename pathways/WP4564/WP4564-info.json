    "description": "During normal neuronal development, neural crest cells participate in migration and invasion processes. The growth factor, BDNF, binds to and activates NGFR (p75NTR) in various contexts, invoking signaling pathways that lead to transcriptional activation in the nucleus.  Also see the closely related pathway, [Neural Crest Cells in Cancer](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4565).",
