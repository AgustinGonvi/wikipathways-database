  "description": "The hydroxylation of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid, to form tyrosine is a major source of the latter amino acid in the body under normal conditions and is also the first step in phenylalanine catabolism. To continue the catabolic process, tyrosine is transaminated to 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate which is broken down to fumarate and acetoacetate (Blau et al. 2001; Mitchell et al. 2001).
