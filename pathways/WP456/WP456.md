description: This pathway was created using the GPCRDB (Horn et al., 1998), http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/7tm/.
  The groupings are based on the GPCR phylogenetic tree available from the GPCRDB
  and the training sets used by Karchin et al. (Bioinformatics, 2002, pg. 147-159).
  The labels indicate children and grandchildren of the various classes of GPCRs as
  described by these references.
