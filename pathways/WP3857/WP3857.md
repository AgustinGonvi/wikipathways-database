description: This pathway is modeled after Figure 5 of the article "Glomerulocystic
  kidney disease" (Bissler, et al. 2010). The gene product Wnt signals two different
  paths titled canonical and non-canonical. The non-canonical path is mediated by
  the membrane bound protein Disheveled (Dvl) which then controls the planar cell
  Polarity. The canonical path on the other hand is mediated by the cytoplasmic protein
  Disheveled (Dvl) and then is effected through b-catenin transcription. The complex
  of Nphp2 and Nphp3 seem to help facilitate the process by controlling the Wnt signaling.  Bergmann,
  et al. (2008) showed that Nphp3 deficiency in Xenopus resulted to planar cell polarity
  defects.
