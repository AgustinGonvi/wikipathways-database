description: Unlike animals, plants are able to de novo synthesize these amino acids
  from pyruvate, 2-oxobutanoate and acetyl-CoA. In plants, biosynthesis follows the
  typical reaction pathways established for the formation of these amino acids in
  microorganisms. Val and Ile are synthesized in two parallel pathways using a single
  set of enzymes. The pathway to Leu branches of from the final intermediate of Val
  biosynthesis. The formation of this amino acid requires a three-step pathway generating
  a 2-oxoacid elongated by a methylene group. In Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassicaceae,
  a homologous three-step pathway is also involved in Met chain elongation required
  for the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates, an important class of specialized
  metabolites.
