description: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a major Ï‰-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) found in fish oil is the source of D-series resolvins (RvDs), one of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) that show potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions (Molfino et al. 2017). The biosynthesis of RvDs occurs mainly during the process of inflammation when endothelial cells interact with leukocytes. Dietary DHA circulates in plasma or is present in cellular membranes as it can easily integrate into membranes. On injury or infection, DHA moves with edema into the tissue sites of acute inflammation where it is converted to exudate RvDs to interact with local immune cells (Kasuga et al. 2008). The initial transformation of DHA by aspirin-acetylated cyclooxygenase-2 or cyclooxygenase-mediated catalysis can produce stereospecific D-resolvins (18(R)- or 18(S)-RvDs respectively). Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions determine the type of D-resolvin formed (RvD1-6) (Serhan et al. 2002, Serhan & Petasis 2011, Serhan et al. 2014).
