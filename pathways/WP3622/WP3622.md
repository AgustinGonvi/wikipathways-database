description: Since early 2000, a number of metabolome analyses have been demonstrated
  using combined hyphenated chromatographic and mass spectral methods as well as nuclear-magnetic-resonance.
  Although metabolite profiling experiments are becoming routine in many research
  groups, making the studies remains expensive and laborious. While the metabolomics
  community is working towards the setup of sharing metabolome data, mining publicly
  available information and demonstrating the richness of integration of multiple
  metabolome datasets remain largely unexploited. The aims of this project are (1)
  to establish a new web-based platform for metabolome meta-analysis and (2) to use
  these sets of combined metabolite levels to explore the diversity of complex metabolic
  networks in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. We constructed our database,
  called AtMetExpress (http://prime.psc.riken.jp/AtMetExpress/), to store the metabolome
  information.
