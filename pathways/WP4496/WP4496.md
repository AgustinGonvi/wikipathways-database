description: Signal transduction through IL1R. Pathway based on Biocarta pathway (M12095).
  https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta/h_il1rPathway  IL-1 signals primarily
  through the IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1). Through expression of cytokines such
  as TNF, TGF-beta and interferons, IL-1 holds a range of inflammatory activities
  that include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules and roles
  in arthritis and septic shock. IL-1 binds to the respective IL-1 receptor however,
  it requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP) to transduce a signal.
  Two kinases (IRAK-1 and IRAK-2) get activated through IL-1 binding to its receptor.
  Via these kinases a cascade gets activated which includes TRAF6, NF-kB activation
  and c-JUN activation. The IL-1 signaling cascade represents a highly conserved response
  to pathogens.
