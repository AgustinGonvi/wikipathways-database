description: Degradation by proteasomes is part of  the mechanism by which cells regulate
  the concentration of proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. Proteasomes are protein
  complexes which degrade unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis, a chemical
  reaction that breaks peptide bonds. Proteins are tagged for degradation by proteasomes
  by the addition of ubiquitin, by ubiquitin ligases. Description adapted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteasome
  Wikipedia].  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP183
